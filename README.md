# ELM
The Erasmian Language Model

ELM is a community driven large language model tailored to the research and education needs of Erasmus University (Netherlands) students and staff.

The model draws inspiration from ChatGPT in terms of architecture, but it aims to be privacy senstitive, environmentally constious, and from and for the Erasmus community. Here are a few key points of ELM:

1. The undelying language model is trained and fine-tuned on academic outputs from Erasmus University, such as scientific papers or student theses;
2. Training and fine-tuning the model is a joint effort of students and staff, transparent for all parties involved;
3. The prompt-response examples used to fine tune the model come from students and staff, not crowdsourcing services;
4. Defining what is the "better" model output also comes from the perspective of research and education.

The true richness of ELM lies in the way its training data is generated. What is the "state-of-the-art" model may change quickly, but quality data will maintain its relevance and ensure that ELM and its future iterations serve the needs of the community that nurtured it.

We hope that the ELM experience becomes a template for community driven, decentralized and purpuseful AI development and application.
