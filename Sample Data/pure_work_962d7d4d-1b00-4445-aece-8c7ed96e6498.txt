Abstract\nJapanese animation, widely known as anime, has a global reach. It is simultaneously broadcasted by\ntraditional media and easily distributed and discussed among fans in the digital and online realms.\nHowever, non-Japanese audiences’ motivations for watching this kind of content remain almost\nunstudied in some countries, with Portugal being one of them. This article presents and discusses\nthe outcomes of an online survey completed by 568 respondents, most of them young and regular\nwatchers of anime. A scale by Rubin and Perse (1987), originally used in regard to the audiences of\nsoap operas, was adapted in the scope of this article. Five main motivations were found for anime\nviewing, with entertainment being the strongest. Age and gender are relevant predictors for the\nsample’s motivations and also influence audience preferences regarding genres. The survey’s\noutcomes are complemented by nine in-depth interviews conducted during an anime convention,\nfurther exploring the motivations derived from the survey.\nKeywords\nAnime, audience studies, Japan, motivations, Portugal

Introduction\nDigital and online media have enabled new consumption patterns and trends to emerge: the access\nto streaming or file-sharing platforms allowed easier access, often peer-to-peer driven, to contents\ntraditionally barred by geographical, linguistic and economic constraints (Evans et al., 2016; Ito,\n2012b; Jenkins, 2006; Jenkins et al., 2013). One of the most relevant trends in recent times has been\na popularity increase in Japanese animation (anime) with non-Japanese audiences, both through\ntraditional and new media channels.\nWhile the growth of anime beyond Japan is widely recognized (Athique, 2016; Ito, 2012b),\naudience motivations for watching anime are almost unexplored in contexts such as Portugal\n(Jorge and Navio, 2013), whose national anime viewers are the focus of this article. Previous\nstudies on its audiences have suggested different but interwoven reasons for anime’s popularity\nabroad. A key idea is the openness of its cultural codes – the absence of a strong cultural odour\n(Iwabuchi, 2002), as explained below – which may foster its chances to be meaningful outside\nJapan. However, at the same time, anime can also be seen and enjoyed due to what may be perceived as its unique features – for Western eyes, at least – such as its aesthetics, themes and forms\nof storytelling, which may fuel escapist motivations – the desire to move away from local realities\nand towards representations of what is afar (i.e. Japan and its specificities). Another recurrent\nreason is the influence of fandom and its collective reception and different productivities (Fiske,\n1992) for promoting anime’s popularity and distribution abroad (Ito, 2012b; Jenkins, 2006). Not\nsurprisingly, considering some common prejudices surrounding fandom (Jenkins, 1992, 2006), its\nniche status, fan practices and animation format may foster misrepresentations amongst nonviewers, who may regard anime as something childish or an odd exoticism (Jorge and Navio,\n2013). Hence, an inquiry into anime viewers’ motivations is a relevant endeavour, one that may not\nonly lead to a better understanding of how Japanese animation became popular but also uncover\nsome of the dynamics by which cultural products cross borders and disseminate through digital\nmedia. Furthermore, anime watching is often tied to more active forms of audience engagement\nand fandom such as cosplay and participation in conventions, which constitute another layer of\nanalysis for the proliferation of this type of content.\nThis study seeks to address this gap in literature by surveying regular Portuguese anime viewers\nabout their motivations to watch Japanese animation. Our approach to fulfilling this goal includes\nadapting a scale to measure anime motivations through exploratory factor analysis, assessing\npotential differences between groups of viewers and anime genres and tying these motivations to\ninvolvement in fandom activities. With this research, we aim to make an innovative contribution\nwithin audience studies by looking at a product that is understudied (anime) in a similarly\nunderstudied context (Portugal).
Anime as a global message\nJapanese animation has a global audience (Athique, 2016; Cooper-Chen, 2011, 2012; Eng, 2012;\nHernández-Pérez et al., 2017; Jorge and Navio, 2013; Meo, 2016; Palumbo and Calabrò, 2017;\nSantiago Iglesias, 2017). However, the reasons for its popularity outside Japan are subject of\nopposing views, foreshadowing the complexity of its reception. Anime puts simultaneously at\nwork global and local identities, national and international influences, transcendent and everyday\nthematics (Napier, 2001).

According to Fennell et al. (2012, p. 441), it is possible to ‘isolate two overarching and seemingly contradictory arguments’ regarding the international popularity of this kind of Japanese\ncultural content. The first sustains that anime, much like other Japanese goods, is marked by an\n‘odourless style’ and, therefore, is more prone to resonate outside Japan’s boundaries, due to the\nopenness of the cultural codes at stake, which increases the chances of it being relatable and\nunderstandable outside Japan. Koichi Iwabuchi’s idea of a cultural odour is focused ‘on the way in\nwhich cultural features of a country of origin and images or ideas of its national, in most cases\nstereotyped, way of life are associated positively with a particular product in the consumption\nprocess’ (Iwabuchi, 2002, p. 27). It ‘has more to do with widely disseminated symbolic images of\nthe country of origin’ (Iwabuchi, 2002, p. 27), such as references to the country’s lifestyle or even\nto ‘racial and bodily images’ (Iwabuchi, 2002, p. 28), than with the factual knowledge about the\ncontents’ birthplace. In fact, it is ‘hard to detect any typical Japanese physiognomy1 from the\ncharacters – instead, a kind of hybrid global “look” hovers on their faces and bodies’, wrote Lu\n(2008, p. 172), also mentioning the recurrence of universal – and, therefore, generic or, at least,\nnon-specifically Japanese – themes, as well as fantasy characters, hardly associated with Japanese\nor any other specific culture or lifestyle. Napier (2001, p. 24) evokes a similar idea: while anime\nmay be regarded as typically Japanese by Westerners, at home, it may be perceived as ‘stateless’,\noccupying a space of its own. This is even more relevant considering that Japan itself is the main\nmarket of anime (Cooper-Chen, 2012; Lamerichs, 2013).\nThe second argument pays attention to anime’s reception abroad and the national representations conveyed. According to Athique (2016, p. 125), the ‘culturally “odourless” style itself came\nto be seen retrospectively as distinctively Japanese’, proving once again the country’s prowess to\nremake something – in this case, anime, which was initially inspired by American cartoons (Lu,\n2008) – to the point of turning it nationally distinctive to others (Tunstall, 2008). While Napier\n(2001, p. 21) also suggests the broader influence of Japanese ‘pictocentrism’ – that is, the centrality\nof the visuals in the country’s culture, which is more relevant there than in the West, for instance2 –\nAzuma (2009, p. 13) notes that ‘most of the characteristics of anime since the 1980s that are seen as\n“otaku-like” or “Japanese” were in fact produced through the mutation of techniques imported\nfrom the United States and a positive reappraisal of the results’. Besides, according to Shiraishi\n(2000), while anime may not look Japanese, it can present strong national representations (hence\ndiverging from a cultural odourlessness), such as the idea of childhood existing in Doraemon. This\nanime, much popular in Asia (Cooper-Chen, 2012) and also aired in Portugal, presents a hopeful\nrelation between children and technology, far from the more common dystopian Western views\n(Shiraishi, 2000). This one may be particularly distinctive of the post–World War II Japan, as the\nlatter author points out, but, as with many elements of the otaku culture, it is not necessarily\nconsonant with ‘good old Japan’ nor isolated from foreign influences, being symptomatic of the\ncountry’s complex postmodern identity (Azuma, 2009). Nevertheless, within this second broad\nperspective, anime is a tool of the relatively recent Japan’s soft power, a symbol of the exportable\n‘Cool Japan’ (Cooper-Chen, 2012; Ito, 2012b). Lu’s work (2008) is useful to understand how both\nperspectives regarding anime’s levels of Japanese odour, rather than being in opposition, are\ninterwoven.\nThe author identifies three kinds of cultural politics underlying these contents. The first one\ncorresponds to the depoliticization of anime, that is, the intentional search for an odourless style\nthat ‘removes cultural barriers for reception, making anime characters more approachable’ for nonJapanese audiences (Lu, 2008, p. 174). This commercial tactic enhanced Pokémon’s or Yu-GiOh’s success abroad, exemplified Lu (2008).3 As a marketing strategy, blurring the contents’
4

origins ‘makes anime popular across cultures because it allows a broader imaginary space of\nidentification for people of various cultures’ (Lu, 2008, pp. 175–176). However, this kind of\nstrategy is accompanied by two others that put Japan at the centre of anime. If the characters may\nnot look Japanese, too often the antagonists draw upon stereotypes of the West. This type of\nOccidentalism – the second cultural politics mentioned by Lu (2008) – presents Western-like\ncharacters – namely muscular blond ones (Lu, 2008, pp. 177–178) – as strong but arrogant and\nimpatient counterparts that eventually are taught a lesson by the main – Japanese – character. The\nlast form of cultural politics is closely related to the previous one but turning its attention to Japan’s\nleading place among other Asian countries. Lu (2008, p. 179) labels this tendency as selforientalism, which depicts neighbour countries with prejudice while obscuring the ‘Asian-ness\nattached to Japanese culture ( . . . ); what emerges is a distant yet familiar halo around Japan’.\nIf Lu’s account highlights the complexity of anime’s representations, we should not neglect that\nit is an umbrella for very different contents. As Fennell et al. (2012) put it:\nIn this way, anime can and does have multiple faces. One program can be focused on Japanese culture,\nwhile another generates a fictional world unlike anything in reality, and another combines fantasy and\nrealism. Furthermore, crossfertilization between Japan and other nations has led to products that draw\nfrom multiple cultures. (p. 443)
This necessarily impacts anime’s reception: while some are admittedly aimed at global audiences, most have the national market as the main target. Therefore, they evoke different cultural\nencyclopaedias for different model-readers (Eco, 1993). That is, it is not certain that the same\nanime is the most popular in every country, as suggested by the exploratory research of CooperChen (2012) in Japan, China and the United States. For that reason, it is crucial to highlight that\nanime, much like any other kind of content, is not monolithic: it has different genres that convey\nspecific elements that distinguish themselves at the moment of their creation and during their\nreception, influencing the kind of cultural codes that (a) are mobilized by authors while creating\nwithin the tradition of a specific genre and to a given model-audience and (b) audiences may also\nexpect to find, at least when they are familiar with the genres at stake (Eco, 1993).\nThese ideas showcase the complexity entailing the creation and circulation of anime. Its\nodourless style, cultural features and different genres mean that anticipating audience motivations\nfor consumption outside of Japan is a complex task. While anime producers may have had a clear\ncode embedded in the production of animated content, this code is likely being negotiated by\nWestern audiences, who bring their own motivations for consumption.
Convergence culture and fan participation\nOne should also consider the impacts of convergence culture and fandom (Jenkins, 2006, 2008) in\nthe complexification of anime’s reception worldwide. The industrial abundance of contents and\nformats referring to a given anime universe, forming a pervasive media mix, and the ‘peer-to-peer\necologies of cultural production and exchange (of information, objects, and money)’ (Ito, 2007, p.\n91) foster different and ever-evolving receptions of the same fictional universe, one where the\nsame object – an anime, for instance – may have different versions, with different audiences.\nAccording to Jenkins (2006, p. 158), ‘the flow of Asian goods into Western markets’ benefited\nfrom both broadcasting and grassroot promotion. During the 1980s, fans started to share among\nthem more or less amateur copies of anime, subtitling these themselves, ‘to fill an unmet consumer\ndemand not being served by commercial industries’ (Ito, 2012a, p. 183): that is, anime was barely

broadcasted. Even when some series were shown in television, as Price (2001, p. 163) noted, the\ncontents’ ‘surface Japaneseness’ was ‘often edited out or covered up by a poor translation’.4 This\nkind of adaptation could change the original content towards more recognizable national references. The purpose was simple: to reach broader local audiences, which may not match the fans’\nexpectations. In Portugal, the national – and still unstudied – dubbing of Dragon Ball Z achieved a\nkind of cult status due to its extreme changes,5 which relied on elements such as national sayings or\neven references to other (at the time) popular contents broadcasted by the same network. However,\nthe grassroot way – and its intermediaries – played ‘a central role in shaping the reception of those\nmedia products, emphasizing rather than erasing the marks of their national origin and educating\nothers about the cultural traditions they embody’ (Jenkins, 2006, p. 162). While it is not a universal\ndesire even among fans (Fennell et al., 2012), the contact with the original, unchanged content – or,\nat least subtitled by peers (Ito, 2012a) – is distinctive of a high commitment level towards anime.\nBesides, as stated by Fennell et al. (2012, p. 446), most of the fans studied by the authors, users of\ntwo English-language forums, ‘not only analysed the content of the anime in isolation but considered the context of the anime’s production, distribution, and exhibition’.\nMany of these intermediaries were ‘pop cosmopolitans’ (Jenkins, 2006) trying to escape from\nlocal communities and representations towards more diverse and global ones – or, at least, towards\n‘stereotyped images of Japan within their construction of “transcultural” fan identities’ (Hills,\n2002, p. 12). Despite the possible escapist motivations mentioned above, which are also present in\nmore recent works (Palumbo and Calabrò, 2017), fandom is recurrently seen through the lens of\nparticipatory culture (Jenkins, 1992). For instance, anime’s popularity in the United States –\nnamely the ones that were not commercially distributed outside Japan – has much to do with\ncollege fan clubs, fans’ networked produsage and, nowadays, participation in online sites (CooperChen, 2012; Eng, 2012; Fennell et al., 2012; Ito, 2012b). Considering the Portuguese reality, there\nare few scholarly works regarding anime’s reception. The one that focuses more strongly on this\nnational context was written by Jorge and Navio (2013), who interviewed managers of national\notaku sites and surveyed 100 fans.6 The authors described a small but organized community, which\nperceived itself as at the margin of the rest of the society, one where online sites, such as forums,\nand offline meetings – informal meets and bigger conventions – contributed to the presence of\nanime in the everyday lives of otaku. That is, the sociability around anime relied on the convergence of face-to-face and mediated encounters (Fiske, 1992; Hills, 2013). Besides, Jorge and\nNavio (2013) highlighted the surprising main profile found among the fans’ – mostly teens and\nyoung adults – self-descriptions: the not-so-committed fans – more willing to watch regularly\nanime, to search for related contents and to buy merchandising – were the majority, not the ones\nwhose practices were more consonant with the classical descriptions of highly productive and\ncommunitarian fans by Jenkins (1992) or Fiske (1992). However, broader and/or newer studies\nregarding the Portuguese youth media practices point out to the same direction: this is a generation of\nregular media consumers, but with scarce or rudimentary production and participation practices\n(Amaral et al., 2017; Pereira and Moura, 2019; Pereira et al., 2018). This article, considering the\nclues pointed out by Jorge and Navio (2013) and the current state of the national media practices\nbriefly described above, aims to map and explore the habits and motivations of the Portuguese otaku.\nFollowing the lack of previous research on anime motivations in the Portuguese landscape, we\nformulate the goals of our research as a set of research questions:\n\n
RQ1: What are the main motivations for anime watching among Portuguese otaku?\nRQ2: Do these motivations differ among gender and age groups?

Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies XX(X)\nRQ3: What motivations are tied to heavy viewing?\nRQ4: What motivations predict the degree of fandom?\nRQ5: Do motivations predict one’s favourite anime genres?
RQ1 has an exploratory purpose, to map out the main motivations for anime viewing. RQ2 looks\nat how different demographic characteristics, such as gender or age, may affect motivations, since\nthese variables have proven to be significant in previous studies (Jenkins, 1992, 2006). In particular,\nage could be a relevant variable since anime is sometimes associated by non-viewers with children,\nto whom, like any other cartoon, these contents were originally broadcasted in Western markets\n(Hernández-Pérez et al., 2017; Jenkins, 2006). This is perceived as a social constraint by the otaku\nthemselves (Jorge and Navio, 2013; Palumbo and Calabrò, 2017). RQ3 and RQ4 focus on the degree\nof commitment and involvement, relating viewing motivations to the number of episodes watched\nper week and the degree of fandom. Finally, RQ5 accounts for the nuances that different genres entail\nin terms of why viewers may be interested in anime.
Method\nA survey was the main method used to assess the habits and motivations of anime audiences in\nPortugal. The survey was targeted at regular anime viewers and included a screening question in\nthe beginning to exclude non-regular viewers. Participants were recruited through the institutional\nemail channels of two large Portuguese universities and through participation appeals published on\nmajor Portuguese anime fan forums and Facebook groups. These respondents received no monetary compensation for their participation.\nA total of 568 participants completed the survey, with 470 being regular anime viewers. Almost all\nlived in mostly urban municipalities, following a national classification of the Portuguese communes\nby Statistics Portugal:7 only 12 respondents from the overall sample lived in municipalities with a\nmajority of mostly rural or, at least, averagely urban communes. From the 470, 2 participants were\nexcluded for giving nonsensical responses to the survey, making the final sample size equal to 468. The\nsample is balanced in terms of gender (49.1% female), with 58.3% of respondents having completed a\nhigher education degree. However, it is important to note that students are overrepresented (69.7%)\nand that the mean age was 22.72 (SD ¼ 4.59). This is a natural occurrence considering the way our\nsurvey was distributed. Although the sample is not representative of the general Portuguese population, it does match the profile of anime fans covered by previous studies (Jorge and Navio, 2013). No\ndata on race or ethnicity were collected in accordance with the Portuguese Constitution.\nResults of the survey were complemented in the discussion section by nine in-depth interviews\nto anime fans conducted in October 2018 at the Iberanime event in Porto, the largest Portuguese\nanime convention. The interviews were conducted by one of the researchers, who randomly\napproached fans during the event. Since convention goers do not typically attend alone, a total of\nthree groups – composed of three female and six male subjects, between 16 years old and 30 years\nold – were interviewed. First, the survey’s measures and results are presented and then the outcomes of the interviews are discussed.
Measures\nMotivations to watch anime were measured by a 20-item scale with five response options ranging\nfrom completely disagree to completely agree. The scale was translated and adapted from a

previous scale on motivations for watching soap operas (Rubin and Perce, 1987). Some items that\ndid not make so much sense in the context of anime, such as ‘ . . . so I can learn about what might\nhappen to me’, were replaced by items deemed to be more suitable for the genre.\nTo assess if the 20 items for viewing motivations could be grouped in broader constructs, we\nconducted factor analysis with principal component analysis. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO)\nmeasure of sampling adequacy had a suitable value (.87), while Bartlett’s test of sphericity was\nsignificant (p < 0.001), indicating that the scale is suitable for factor analysis. Unlike in the original\nscale, which had six components, Principal Components factor analysis extracted five factors\naccording to Kaiser’s criterion. A direct oblimin rotation was used since we assume some motivation\ntypes may be correlated, with the factor loadings being reported in Table 1. Our subscales for\nEntertainment (M ¼ 4.32, SD ¼ 0.58, a ¼ .75), Pass Time (M ¼ 3.09, SD ¼ 1.11, a ¼ .72), and\nEscapism (M ¼ 3.31, SD ¼ 1.18, a ¼ .73) have similar content to the original ones. However, our\nfactor analysis has grouped information and social motivations on a single subscale, which we\nlabelled Socioinformational (M ¼ 3.06, SD ¼ 0.79, a ¼ .83), and grouped two items that were\ndistributed amongst other components in the original scale which seem to be related to Parasocial

interaction (M ¼ 3.36, SD ¼ 1.15, a ¼ .83) (Horton and Whol, 1956). The attractive characters item\nwas removed from this final scale since ignoring it improved the scale’s reliability substantially.\nEach component’s score was averaged to comprise a measure for that specific kind of motivation.\nIn terms of definitions, Entertainment refers to thrill seeking or other kinds of emotional\nenjoyment as a reason to watch anime, while Escapism is connected to seeking distractions or\nimmersive experiences that remove the viewer from their everyday issues. Passing time is selfexplanatory and refers to viewing as a way to remain occupied in the absence of more appealing\nactivities. Socioinformational motivations deal with both the social and the informational aspects\nof anime viewing, tied to seeking social experiences and learning. Since socialization processes are\nconnected to learning, it makes sense to group these two concepts. Finally, Parasocial interaction\nstems from the original definition suggested by Horton and Whol (1956), which defines a face-toface like interaction with fictional media characters.\nThe degree of fandom, in turn, was assessed through six binary questions that asked respondents\nabout a series of previous typical experiences related to anime fandom. The items concerned\nparticipation in anime conventions, cosplay, reading manga, drawing manga or anime, visiting\nanime websites or forums, and membership of fan groups on social networks. The number of ‘yes’\nanswers to these items was then used as an indication of the respondent’s degree of fandom (M ¼\n2.97, SD ¼ 1.67). Note that this measure emphasizes the ubiquity of anime and the diversity of\nactivities rather than (self-stated) intensity. While referential definitions of fandom (Fiske, 1992;\nJenkins, 1992) highlight its relevance to the fans’ identities (individual and social), which is\ntranslated in higher degrees of commitment and interest, and in more complex practices, the\ndiversity of the fans’ activities is a common ground shared by them. Besides, works such as the\nones presented by Jorge and Navio (2013) or Bourdaa and Lozano Delmar (2016) emphasize the\nrelevance of those transmedia practices in the fans’ self-concepts of fandom.\nAnime watching frequency was assessed using a self-reported measure of how many episodes\nthe respondent watches on an average week. Although self-reported measures can be unreliable\nand susceptible to overestimation (Prior, 2009), the impossibility of collecting behavioural data\nmeans that no better alternative could be considered. While the data seem to confirm the tendency\nfor exaggerated figures (M ¼ 8.84, SD ¼ 10.72), only values above 70 episodes per week were\ntreated as outliers (n ¼ 19) since binge-watching habits could make watching 10 episodes per day\nfeasible, albeit unlikely. Although some respondents reported watching 0 episodes per week on\naverage, they were not excluded from the analysis since answers to open-ended questions showed\nthat these were fans who had watched anime regularly in the past, but could not presently find the\ntime to do so, meaning that they fit the criteria of our study.\nFinally, we also assessed anime consumption habits in terms of genres. Because participants may\nnot always be familiar with certain industry designations for genres (e.g. Shounen), and since there is\nno guarantee of consensus among those that are, we used an indirect approach to assessing genre\npreferences among anime viewers. Each respondent was asked to list their three favourite anime\nseries. Their responses were then crossed with the community led anime database myanimelist.net,\nwhich categorizes each series in terms of genres. Each series was coded in a binary way (1 or 0) for\neach of the genres and an individual score was obtained by adding the values for each respondent.\nThis score therefore varies between 0 and 3 for a total of 37 different genres, with 0 indicating none\nof the respondents’ favourite series belonged to that genre and 3 indicating all of their favourite series\nbelonged to the genre.\nSince 37 genres would be too numerous to analyse in relation to five motivations, dimension\nreduction statistical techniques were used to group the genres in meaningful clusters, similarly to

what was done for the motivation scales. As a first step, six genres that appeared in less than 5% of\nthe sample (n < 29, Dementia, Harem, Josei, Kids, Space, Vampire) were excluded from the\nanalysis since they were unlikely to yield representative and generalizable results. The remaining\n31 genres were subjected to exploratory factor analysis using principal components analysis. The\nKMO measure of sampling adequacy had a suitable value (.67) while Bartlett’s test of sphericity\nwas significant (p < .001), indicating that the data are suitable for factor analysis. Since Kaiser’s\ncriterion of eigenvalues higher than 1 suggested a number of components that was still too high for\nanalysis, a scree plot (Figure 1) was used to determine the number of components at six.\nTable 2 lists the rotated pattern matrix with factor loadings for each of the six genre groups.\nItems included in each of the components are highlighted in boldface. Varimax rotation was used\nsince we do not expect genre components to be correlated and factor loadings under .40 were\nomitted. Component 1 was labelled as Shounen (M ¼ 0.91, SD ¼ 0.70, a ¼ .87) since other genres\nin this category embody characteristics of shounen genre. This type of anime series usually targets\na younger (usually male) audience and focuses on the journey of a hero who fights against evil and\ngrows up in the process. Well-known examples of this component are series like Dragon Ball and\nNaruto. Component 2 was labelled Mature (M ¼ 0.28, SD ¼ 0.37, a ¼ .84) because genres like\nhorror or psychological tend to target an older audience who is clearly distinct from the shounen\none. Component 3 was labelled as Shoujo (M ¼ 0.25, SD ¼ 0.37, a ¼ .66) since this reflects the\nkind of anime normally produced for a young female audience, being usually a counterpart to the\nmore male-oriented shounen anime. A popular example of this category would be the Sailor Moon\nseries. Component 4 was labelled War & Sci-Fi (M ¼ 0.24, SD ¼ 0.37, a ¼ .66) based on the\ncomprised genres. Although the Drama genre also loaded under this component, its inclusion\nwould have made the scale unreliable (a ¼ .54). Component 5 was labelled Everyday Life (a ¼ .53)

Results\nThe means from our motivation scales reveal that entertainment motivations are predominant\namong Portuguese anime viewers (M ¼ 4.32, SD ¼ 0.58) by a large margin. These are then followed by parasocial (M ¼ 3.36, SD ¼ 1.15) and escapist (M ¼ 3.31, SD ¼ 1.18) motivations. In

turn, passing time (M ¼ 3.09, SD ¼ 1.11) and socioinformational (M ¼ 3.06, SD ¼ 0.79) motivations display the lowest means. When conducting paired samples t-tests to compare the means,\nwe find significant (p < 0.01) differences across all means except between parasocial and escapist\nmotivations (t ¼ 0.81, p ¼ 0.419) and between passing time and socioinformational motivations (t\n¼ 0.44, p ¼ 0.658). Answering RQ1, this allows us to set a clear-cut hierarchy of motivations with\nentertainment at the top, followed by escapism and parasocial interaction and with socioinformational and passing time motivations at the bottom. This clearly establishes anime as part of\nthe entertainment industry, with potential educational or social purposes being considered less\nimportant by viewers.\nTo answer RQ2, a linear regression was run for each of the motivation types for watching\nanime. The standardized coefficients, standard errors and significance are reported for each\ndependent variable in Table 3. This allows us to gauge the influence of each demographic predictor\non motivations to watch anime. Age was a significant negative predictor for all motivation types\nexcept for passing time, which may indicate that the overall motivation to watch anime may\ndecrease with age. However, it is also noteworthy that socioinformational motivations tend to\ndecrease for respondents with higher education (b ¼ 0.12, SE ¼ 0.08, p ¼ 0.024) and that\nescapist motivations are higher for female viewers (b ¼ 0.16, SE ¼ 0.11, p < 0.001). Although the\nexplained variance values are quite low, ranging from 3% to 6%, results nevertheless show that\ndifferent demographic characteristics have an impact on one’s motivations to watch anime.\nEducated respondents may have already acquired the knowledge they could obtain from anime\nfrom other sources. Regarding gender differences, despite significant differences in terms of\ngeography, time and media product, it may be that Radway’s (1991) conclusions regarding the\nescapist motivations of women to read romance novels also apply to anime. It is likely that higher\nsocial constraints are placed upon the everyday lives of female viewers that lead them to see anime\nas a way to escape. Although plausible, both of these explanations warrant further research beyond\nthe context of this study.\nTo assess predictors for the number of episodes watched per week (RQ3), a negative binomial\nregression was performed since the dependent variable concerns overdisperse count data (Table 4).\nRespondents who are studying watch a lower number of episodes per week. Additionally, younger\naudiences tend to have heavier viewing habits. In terms of motivations, parasocial motivations are\nthe significant driver of an increase in viewing frequency, while viewing to pass time is a negative\npredictor of the number of episodes per week. This suggests that maintaining a connection with the

fictional characters in anime is the main reason why viewers develop heavy viewing habits, as\nopposed to more casual motivations like passing time.\nRegarding RQ4, a linear regression was run to assess predictors for the degree of fandom (Table\n5). In this case, gender was the strongest predictor of involvement in fandom activities, with female\nviewers being significantly more involved than males. In terms of demographics, age was the other\nsignificant predictor of fandom, with older audiences being less likely to take part in those\nactivities. Concerning motivations, both entertainment and parasocial interaction were significant\npositive predictors of fandom participation. Not only does parasocial interaction drive heavier\nviewing habits, but it also leads to more participation in fan activities.\nTo answer RQ5, each of the five genre components was used as a dependent variable with the\nfive motivation subscales used as predictors (Table 6). Because some of these genres are strongly\ndefined by the audience they target, age and gender were also included as predictors. Despite the

large sample size, results concerning the Historical genre should be interpreted with caution since\nthe distribution for this variable had a high kurtosis (7.31). Results show that gender is the strongest\npredictor for three of the five genre groups. As expected, males tend to watch more Shounen anime,\nwhile females prefer Shoujo, shown, respectively, by negative and positive coefficients in the table.\nAdditionally, male viewers tend to select War & Sci-Fi anime as their favourite genre as well.\nAlthough the Shounen and Shoujo anime are usually directed at younger audiences, we see here that\nage does not play a role in predicting favouritism of these genres, probably because most of our\nsample was already over 18 years old. It is noteworthy, however, that younger viewers actually\npreferred genres within the Mature category, while older viewers favoured War & Sci-Fi and Historical anime. While it is difficult to pinpoint a specific reason for this apparently counterintuitive\nfinding, it may be that younger viewers have broader access to this type of content than previous\ngenerations, since the Mature genres were not among those initially chosen for television broadcast\nin Portugal. Even if these older fans now also have access to Mature anime, nostalgia may be driving\nthem to select the broadcasted, non-Mature series from their childhood as their favourite ones.\nIn terms of actual motivations, parasocial motives were a positive predictor of favouring\nShounen anime and a negative one for Mature. Identifying with the characters therefore seems to\nbe more important when following a hero’s journey, rather than in the usually more complex\nMature anime genres. Socioinformational motivations were a negative predictor for Shoujo anime,\nindicating that viewers who watch shows with romance and directed at a female audience tend to\ndo it less to discuss it with other viewers and to learn about the world. This offers a stark contrast\nwith the motivations found in studies about the comparable live acting genre of soap operas.\nFinally, entertainment was also a significant positive predictor for watching Historical anime.
Discussion\nOur study revealed unique insights into Portuguese anime viewers’ motivations. The fact that\nentertainment was the main motivation is not surprising, considering it aligns with the findings\nfrom the scale’s original article (Rubin and Perse, 1987). However, the finding that parasocial and\nescapist motivations surpass socioinformational and pass time motivations is a relevant one. The\n‘odourless’ style of anime makes it a very flexible viewing experience (Fennell et al., 2012),\nsubject to very personal interpretations. Therefore, unlike soap operas, it does not provide a clear
14
Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies XX(X)
and common social referent that is shared in discussion. The fact that anime is also a niche product\nin the Portuguese media landscape also undermines its value as a conversational topic outside\nfandom. In fact, during the anime event where the nine interviews were conducted, all respondents\nagreed that anime is commonly seen as a genre for children and, for that, they often feel criticized\nby non-anime fans. In contrast, the fact that activities like cosplay are prominent for anime fans\nembodies the immersion and connection tied to parasocial motivations and is an example of how\nfandom can still be a place to develop more particular (and very meaningful) tastes (Fiske, 1992;\nJenkins, 1992). Because the more intensive experiences of anime watching favour these higher\nlevels of involvement, this means that anime is not seen as something viewed to simply pass time.\nIn terms of gender differences, female respondents were more driven by escapist motivations.\nThis is in line with earlier studies on fandom (Jenkins, 1992), where fans were still part of a niche\npathologized by the mainstream. For females, who used to take the lead in practices such as fan\n(re)writing (Jenkins, 1992), their fandom of sci-fi contents like Star Trek was particularly\nimportant to assert identities and to cope with an overall patriarchal society and media contents\ncreated mostly for male audiences (with the exception of genres such as soap operas). Sci-fi,\ndespite having male model-audiences in mind, was a sufficient open-ended genre to foster their\nappropriations and extrapolations of the original contents to make them more suitable to their\nworld visions and ambitions and to their storytelling preferences (Jenkins, 1992). This might also\nbe the case of anime in Portugal, where these contents are still watched by a niche not always\nkindly perceived by the rest of society and whose themes, as mentioned in the theoretical\nframework, might be open enough to more easily resonate across cultures (Lu, 2008). Females’\nescapist motivations might also help to understand their significantly more regular presence in fan\nactivities: much like the pop cosmopolitans studies by Jenkins (2006) or the fan fiction writers\nabout Star Trek (Jenkins, 1992), the movement away from the mundane was also a way of\napproaching others who were also in the margins and who would share niche interests.\nAge was tied to a reduction in a number of different motivations for watching. However,\nbecause all coefficients were negative, it is more likely that age is associated with a reduction in\nmotivations in general than to a specific change in the motivation profile. Since there is a considerable age gap between all interviewees, it was possible to verify that the younger they were and\nthe fewer responsibilities they had due to more flexible schedules, the more episodes they watched\nper day or week, in line with the results from the survey. On the other hand, as adulthood and\nprofessional life became priorities, consumption hours decreased significantly. The complexification of one’s life while getting older might also explain this decrease of motivations, despite\nthe popularity that anime may retain among adults, as suggested by the survey’s open-ended\nquestions mentioned above. During the interviews, a young woman (aged 30) referred that she\ndoes not have much time available to watch anime due to her professional life. Besides, she also\nmentioned that, after being an otaku for a while, she watches less anime each day: ‘now that I feel\npart of the community [anime consumption] is lower. However, when I discovered anime, all I\nwanted was to watch the maximum of episodes I could’. This later motivation was also verified\namong other interviewees, with the older ones being more selective about the series to watch, since\nprofessional schedules and obligations occupy most of their time, and the younger ones still being\non the ‘discovery phase’.\nIn terms of number of episodes viewed per week, parasocial interaction was the main driver of\nheavier consumption habits. This suggests that motivations like escapism and entertainment do not\nnecessarily lead viewers to watch more episodes, but people who are driven by establishing\nrelations with the characters and the world of anime are prone to viewing more. In fact, two female
Gonçalves et al.
15
interviewees pointed three main motivations: accompanying the character’s evolution throughout\nthe series, feelings they had towards the show or characters and life lessons they could learn from\nthe events in the series. This may also relate to the different motivations for watching different\ngenres, since survey respondents who preferred Shounen anime had higher parasocial motivations\nthan those who watched Mature anime. It is noteworthy that this relational aspect is an important\naspect of the otaku culture and lifestyle in Japan, with several products such as figurines, body\npillows and other merchandise that enables fans to bring their fictional characters to the ‘real’\nworld. To a certain extent, the prominence of parasocial interaction motivations for heavy viewers\nmay be mirroring the Japanese context.\nOverall, our study showcases the complexity that underlies anime consumption in a nonJapanese context. The motivations for watching anime are different depending on one’s age,\ngender and education, hinting at the fact that individuals with different profiles are driven by\ndifferent reasons to watch. This might be symptomatic of the odourless feature of anime (of its\ncultural openness) but also of the diversity (of contents, of representations, etc.) that this kind of\ncontent encompasses, which stresses the need to further investigate beyond stereotypes or categories too broad that enable us to grasp the nuances of anime reception. In turn, these motivations\nare connected with different viewing habits, with parasocial interaction being a clear reason for\nwatching a higher number of episodes and involvement in fan activities.\nThe complexity of anime does not mean, however, that there is an absence of patterns in anime\nconsumption. This is illustrated, for instance, when we look at the different genres. While certain\naudience characteristics match the ones implied by the original Japanese genres, such as males\nwatching more Shounen anime and females preferring Shoujo anime. Other features are not\nmapped so cleanly to a Western context (e.g. younger viewers preferred Mature anime and age was\ncompletely unrelated to Shounen anime, traditionally aimed at younger audiences). This might be a\ngood example of the intricate relation established by the more or less prevailing cultural odour of\nanime and the specificities of a foreigner context of reception, as well as with individual motivations (Napier, 2001); one that should be developed in future studies.\nWhile the otaku community tends to be stereotyped, especially by those who do not belong to it,\nour research points at a more complex portrayal of anime. While anime has certain characteristics\nthat make it distinctive, its genres, audiences and motivations are diverse enough to warrant a\nnuanced and complex approach. As such, future quantitative and qualitative inquiries into anime\nconsumption should clearly distinguish the viewer who watches Shounen, who relates to the\ncharacters and who participates in conventions, from the one who prefers Mature anime and for\nwhom relating to the characters is not the main reason to watch. In conclusion, talking about the\nanime community may make as much sense as talking about the moviegoing community. It is a\nuseful term to identify the format, but also a broad one that encompasses many realities, including\nsome that defy the codes of the context of production where the format originated.
Limitations and future research\nAlthough this study provides a glimpse into Portuguese anime viewers’ motivations, it is nevertheless a limited portrayal of this audience. The fact that the survey was distributed through\nuniversity email addresses and online communities and social network groups limits the scope of\nthis study to a subsection of the audience that is restricted either in terms of age or in terms of\nfollowing online communities. It is therefore possible that a substantial part of anime viewers that\ndoes not fit in these categories was not captured by our study. Additionally, the fact that self-
16
Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies XX(X)
reported measures were used to estimate the amount of viewing may have also skewed the results,\nsince audiences are not always accurate at estimating their media consumption habits (Prior, 2009).\nFuture research may look into different countries and contexts to find out if there are significant\ndifferences in audience motivations to watch anime. Furthermore, because non-anime viewers\noften have preconceptions regarding anime fans, it may be interesting to explore and compare nonviewers perceptions of motivations to watch anime with the actual motivations of anime viewers.\nOverall, this article highlights the heterogenous motivations and profiles of anime viewers,\nshowing that future studies should address the complexity and richness that the anime format\nentails in terms of its contents and audiences.\nAuthors’ Note\nCatarina Navio is now affiliated with Communication and Society Research Centre, University of\nMinho, Portugal.\nORCID iD\nJoão Gonçalves https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8948-0455\nPedro Moura https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1807-7447\nNotes\n1. Iwabuchi (2002, p. 28) uses the word mukokuseki, ‘literally meaning ‘something or someone lacking any\nnationality’, to describe anime’s characters. However, its use also suggests ‘the mixing of elements of\nmultiple cultural origins’ (Iwabuchi, 2002, p. 71).\n2. According to Napier (2001, p. 21), ‘most commentators on manga suggest that the origins of the form go\nback at least to the Edo period (1600-1868)’. To her, ‘certainly some images from earlier periods would not\nseem out of place in contemporary anime or manga’, as the author compares the grotesque of Katsushika\nHokusai’s print, from 1824, The Dream of the Fisherman’s Wife with some of ‘anime’s more sadistic\npornography’ (Napier, 2001, p. 21).\n3. The (apparent) westernization of anime’s characters did not begin as an exportation tactic, as Cooper-Chen\n(2012) notes. The author traces its origins – namely the big-eye style – to the work of Osamu Tezuka, to\nwhom Walt Disney’s cartoons were an inspiration even when creating for national audiences.\n4. Promoting Japaneseness – while ‘telling the audience what “authentic” Japan looks like’ (Kamm, 2017,\np. 46) – may be also a commercial tactic, even if directed to more niche markets (Kamm, 2017).\n5. The Portuguese dubbing is the subject of two videos from the YouTuber MasakoX: the original ‘IS THIS\nDUB THE “ULTIMATE” DUB?|A Dragonball Discussion’ (https://youtu.be/cyNBnBNc56Q) and the\nsequel ‘THE INSIDE SCOOP OF THE “ULTIMATE” DUB w/ João Loy|A Dragon Ball Discussion’\n(https://youtu.be/dSUJwMY6JcY), where the actor who voiced Vegeta explained the changes, evoking\ndemands from the network who broadcasted Dragon Ball Z and the need to make the contents resonate\nwith national audiences.\n6. The master’s thesis of Castanheira (2012) and Pinto (2013) also approach some traits of the Portuguese\notaku. The first one is an international study and one-third of its sample is made of Portuguese fans. The\nsecond is focused on national cosplay. Both highlighted common features already mentioned by the\ninternational texts already cited: the importance of fansubbing (Castanheira, 2012) or the convergence\nof online and offline sociability as a crucial element to foster the fandom (Pinto, 2013), for instance.\n7.
