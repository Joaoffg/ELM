SEEING DOUBLE:\nThe effects of YouTubers and TikTokers transferring sponsored content across social media\nplatforms.
ABSTRACT\nOver the years, traditional marketing strategies have become less effective, giving rise to newer and\nmore effective marketing strategies, including influencer marketing. Letting an external party –\ninfluencers – communicate a brand’s marketing messages for them has proven to have positive effects\non consumer responses such as brand attitude and purchase intention. Many influencers start out on\none social media platform – their platform of origin – only to extend their social presence to other\nplatforms as well in order to stay relevant to their (potential) audience. This can lead to content\ntransference, meaning that influencers can post their original content from their platform of origin on\ntheir other platforms as well. The aim of this study is to examine whether this content transference\nfrom the platform of origin, being either TikTok or YouTube, to Instagram will lead to changes in\nconsumer responses. The specific consumer responses that are studied are content liking, brand\nattitude, and purchase intention as they have been proven to be the most interesting and important in\nthe field of influencer marketing. Based on previous research, predictions were made on the effects of\nthis content transference, which were translated into seven hypotheses. In order to examine the effects\nof content transference on these consumer responses, an experiment was conducted. A total of 200\nvalid responses were collected, having a perfect distribution of respondents among the five conditions.\nIn the four experimental conditions, respondents were shown certain stimulus material with conditions\n1 and 2 being shown either sponsored content on or transferred from YouTube, and conditions 3 and 4\nbeing shown either sponsored content on or transferred from TikTok. In the control condition, no\nsponsored content was shown to the respondents. Overall, no significant differences were found in all\nthree consumer responses across the conditions, meaning that YouTubers, as well as TikTokers, are\nsuccessful when it comes to transferring their sponsored content to another platform like Instagram.\nHowever, it was also found that all experimental conditions showed a decrease in brand attitude and\npurchase intention in comparison to the control condition. This is in contrast with previous studies in\nthe field of influencer marketing which found that this marketing strategy will have positive effects on\nthese consumer responses. Due to the findings being either the opposite of what was anticipated or not\nsignificant, limitations for this study were found with the relatively small sample size of the\nexperiment being the main determinant. Based on these limitations combined with this study’s\nstrengths, recommendations for future research were developed.

Introduction\nRecently, traditional marketing has proven to become less effective since individuals have
become more aware of the manipulative and sometimes even misleading character of marketing\nmessages (Heath, Cluley, & O’Malley, 2017). As a result of this, they are building up resistance\ntowards these persuasion attempts (Dey, Yen, & Samuel, 2020). For this particular form of resistance,\nthere are multiple reasons. First of all, according to the reactance theory, individuals like to be\nautonomous and independent (Miron & Brehm, 2006). This means that they would rather make their\nown decisions instead of being persuaded into making these decisions. Besides that, they dislike\ndeception, which is often incorporated into traditional marketing advertisements as the promoted\nproduct or service is frequently getting sugarcoated (De Bakker, 2017). This resistance can present\nitself in multiple ways, which is why the ACE typology was formulated, distinguishing three types of\nresistance strategies: Avoidance, Contesting, and Empowerment (Fransen et al., 2015). These three\nstrategies can be seen as levels related to the amount of effort put into the resistance towards an\nadvertisement. Because of this, there was a need for an innovative, more effective marketing approach.\nThe digital age has provided newer and more effective marketing strategies, one of which is\ninfluencer marketing. With this type of strategy, companies use influential individuals as independent\nthird-party endorsers by letting them communicate certain marketing messages for them (Freberg et\nal., 2011; Gross & Wangenheim, 2018; Woods, 2016). These influential individuals are best known by\nthe term ‘influencers’, characterized by their large following and documentation of their life (Abidin &\nOts, 2016). As a result of this large following, companies can reach newer audiences and thus increase\ntheir extended reach (Childers, Lemon, & Hoy, 2019). The reason why influencer marketing works so\nwell is the fact that these influencers have built a relationship with their audience that is based on trust,\nrelatability, and (wishful) identification (Schouten, Janssen, & Verspaget, 2020). Due to this, it is more\nlikely that a company’s message will be perceived as trustworthy and credible when it is\ncommunicated by an influencer (Lou & Yuan, 2019). This has proven to have positive effects on\nconsumer responses like brand attitude and purchase intention (Müller, Mattke, & Maier, 2018;\nTafesse & Wood, 2021).\nFor the most part, influencers rise to fame on one specific social media platform, which will\nbe referred to as their ‘platform of origin’ in this thesis. However, over time, many influencers have\nstarted expanding to other platforms by uploading content on these platforms as well. So, they cannot\nbe pinned down to just one platform anymore. This mainly has to do with the fact that their (potential)\naudience is active on more platforms than just the influencer’s platform of origin (Hamdan & Lee,\n2021). Previous studies found that the average consumer is active on at least eight social media\nplatforms, with Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp being the most used, and use platforms in a\ncomplementary manner (DataReportal, 2021; (Verbeij et al., 2021). So, for influencers to proceed in\ngrowing their audience and thus to stay relevant, they need to be present on more platforms than just\ntheir platform of origin.\n3
Despite being used by the same influencers, different social media platforms contain different\ntypes of content. Two major platforms where influencers get discovered are YouTube and TikTok\n(Anderson, 2020; Xiao, Wang, & Chan-Olmsted, 2018). Even though they are both video-sharing\nplatforms, there is still a difference in content originating from these platforms. On YouTube, the most\npopular trends are vlogs (i.e., short for video blog and can be seen as a diary in the form of a video),\ngaming videos, sketches, tutorials, and challenges (Ferchaud et al., 2018). On TikTok, however, you\nmostly find lip-syncing and dancing videos, memes, and challenges (Mackenzie & Nichols, 2020).\nThis difference is mainly caused by the length of the content as TikTok videos are usually much\nshorter than YouTube videos due to format restrictions (Cheng, Dale, & Liu, 2007; Zhou, 2019).\nInstagram is also a popular platform for influencer marketing, however, on this platform, most content\nis posted in the form of a photo (Manovich, 2016). Many influencers that started on YouTube (from\nnow on referred to as YouTubers) or TikTok (from now on referred to as TikTokers) do not only use\ntheir platform of origin for their partnerships with brands but also extend these partnerships to\nInstagram. However due to the nature of Instagram, in most cases, content related to the original\ncontent will be posted in the form of a photo. Here, the loss in information richness might potentially\ndeteriorate the effectiveness of the original message. Information richness is an important factor when\nit comes to the power of sponsored content as both the quality and quantity of the information about\nthe promoted brand or product can lead to higher levels of trust and credibility (Chesney et al., 2017;\nStubb, Nyström, & Colliander, 2019. These two factors were found to be important mediators for\nconsumer responses such as content liking, brand attitude, and purchase intention (Tafesse & Wood,\n2021). So, a loss in this area might negatively affect consumer responses.
1.1
Research question\nTo investigate whether messages are equally effective when being transferred from the
platform of origin – either YouTube or TikTok – to Instagram, this thesis will focus on the following\nresearch question: “To what extent are YouTubers and TikTokers achieving similar levels of content\nliking, brand attitude, and purchase intention when transferring their sponsored content to\nInstagram?”. YouTubers and TikTokers are deemed successful in transferring content when achieving\nsimilar or higher levels of content liking, brand attitude, and purchase intention for the sponsored\ncontent transferred from their platform of origin compared to the sponsored content on their platform\nof origin. The reason why these three consumer responses are the most interesting to study is the fact\nthat most studies regarding influencer marketing focus on how consumers react to the content and how\nthis affects their decision-making process regarding a product or brand (Bakker, 2018; Stubb, 2019).\nThis makes the concepts of content liking, brand attitude, and purchase intention the most compelling\nto measure the effectiveness of the sponsored content across social media platforms. As mentioned in\nthe last section, the platforms Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are all very popular, yet different,\nplatforms where influencer marketing takes place, making them the most relevant for this study.\n4
Since this thesis studies causal relationships between variables, an experiment was conducted\nto find the answer to this research question (Neuman, 2014). Within this experiment, participants were\nrandomly divided into one out of five conditions (i.e., four experimental conditions and one control\ncondition). In the four experimental conditions, respondents were exposed to certain stimulus material.\nOut of these four conditions, in two of them, respondents were shown sponsored content from the\nplatform of origin being either YouTube and TikTok, while in the other two, respondents were shown\na sponsored post on Instagram related to the original content from either YouTube or TikTok. The\nexperiment continued by asking the same validated questions regarding consumer responses across all\nconditions. This made it possible to look for differences in the attained levels of content liking, brand\nattitude, and purchase intention between the control condition and experimental conditions.
1.2
Scientific and societal relevance\nThis research holds great scientific and societal relevance. The scientific relevance stems from
the fact that even though previous research has examined the effectiveness of influencer marketing on\ndifferent platforms and the influencers’ origin of fame (Haenlein et al., 2020; Sinning, 2019), little is\nknown about the difference in the effectiveness of content transference by influencers originating from\ndifferent platforms. First of all, Haenlein et al. (2020) provide advice for brands who are interested in\nengaging in influencer marketing, of which studying platform-specific culture is one of them. They go\ninto detail about how influencer marketing and social media platforms are closely connected, mainly\nfocusing on user motives, platform popularity, and the format of the content per platform. Based on\nthis, they stated that the platforms Instagram and TikTok scored the highest and thus could be the most\neffective for influencer marketing. However, these assumptions are not backed up by either qualitative\nor quantitative research – for example, interviews or surveys – examining consumers’ responses to\nsponsored content originating from different social media platforms. Adding to this, they introduce the\nidea that brands should focus on one social media platform specifically, instead of exploring the idea\nof using multiple social media platforms and transferring the sponsored content. Besides this, in her\nbook, Sinning (2019) divides influencers into two categories: those who found their fame online due to\nthe display of their personality and/or lifestyle (online fame-origin) and those who found their fame\ndue to outstanding performances and/or achievements (analog fame-origin). Between these two\ngroups, differences were found in the level of identification, expertise, and trustworthiness, all\naffecting consumer responses. However, since there are multiple different social media platforms\nwhere an influencer can find its ‘online fame’, this category might be too broad to draw one overall\nconclusion. That is why this study will dive deeper into the category of influencers with an online\nfame-origin, by separating them based on their platform of origin. Also, it will focus more on the\nsponsored content as a whole, determining how this content and its effects on consumer responses\ndiffer on and across social media platforms, for example, due to the information richness or\naccessibility of the content, which will be supported by an experiment. This way the effects of content\n5
transference on consumer responses are studied, by comparing the effectiveness of sponsored content\non Instagram that was transferred by YouTubers and TikTokers with the original content. By studying\nthe content transference across social media platforms in this manner, this research will tap into the\ngaps of previous research (Sandberg & Alvesson, 2011).\nThe findings of this study can also impact stakeholders, resulting in societal relevance\n(Lindgreen et al., 2020). Since consumer responses are studied, this can be of value for both\ninfluencers and brands (Braatz, 2017; Segova, 2020). For influencers, the effects of content\ntransference on content liking might be the most interesting (Ishani, 2019). As was established, the\neffectiveness of using influencers for marketing purposes depends mainly on the relationship they\nhave with their audience. A variable like content liking is very interesting for influencers to see what\ncontent does well with their (potential) audience and what does not so that they can play into this. This\nmight be even more so the case for larger influencers; macro-influencers, with a following between\n100K and 1M, and mega-influencers, with a following over 1M (Gómez, 2019). For them, it might be\nharder to ask and receive feedback from their entire audience to get insight into this (Duffy, 2020).\nEspecially compared to smaller influencers; micro-influencers with a following up to 100K, who can\nmore easily get an overview of this (Kay, Mulcahy, & Parkinson, 2020). However, they can also\nbenefit from knowing the effects of content transference on brand attitude and purchase intention as\nthey will get an idea of how influential their content can be regarding consumer responses. Through\nthe findings of this study, influencers can not only ensure that they will be able to create content that\nwill most likely be in line with the preferences of their (potential) audience, but they can also validly\nincrease their price for spreading the same sponsored content across social media platforms. Brands\nwill mainly benefit from information about the effects of content transference on brand attitude and\npurchase intention (Patel, Gadhavi, & Shukla, 2017). For them, it would be interesting to find out what\nthe effectiveness of content transference might be since they are paying more money for this additional\nexposure on a second platform.
1.3
Thesis structure\nIn the following chapter, a theoretical framework is created by discussing previous academic
literature on the concepts of influencer marketing, content liking, brand attitude, purchase intention,\nand the social media platforms Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. This literature will assist in\nanticipating the findings of this study, resulting in multiple hypotheses to test. The method chapter will\ndelve deeper into how the experiment was structured, materials were chosen, and the sampling plan\nwas constructed. In the following chapter, the experiment’s results will be discussed. Finally, the\nfindings will be transformed into a conclusion that answers the research question, which can be found\nin the fifth chapter. In addition, any limitations of this study and future recommendations will be\nintroduced. At the end of this thesis, a reference list and three appendices containing details and\nfindings regarding the experiment can be found.\n6

Theoretical Framework\nThis chapter serves as a discussion of previous academic literature on the concepts of
influencer marketing, the consumer responses content liking, brand attitude, and purchase intention,\nand the social media platforms Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, so that a theoretical framework is\ncreated.
2.1
Influencer marketing
2.1.1
The foundation of influencer marketing\nTo get a better understanding of the concept of influencer marketing, it is important to go back
to the basics and look at its foundation. At the core lies the two-step flow theory of communication\nfrom Lazarsfeld, Bernard, and Gaudet (1944). Their theory describes the indirect communication\nbetween news media and the public, which goes through opinion leaders – that is individuals with a\nremarkable amount of influence within their network through which they can impact the opinions of\nindividuals within this network, thus making them powerful distributors of information (Chaney,\n2001; Parau et al., 2017). So, this implies two steps of communication: the first step being the\ninfluence from news media onto opinion leaders, and the second step from the opinion leaders onto the\npublic. This same interpersonal communication flow can also be found within influencer marketing.\nHere, the news media is replaced by brand X who wants to convey a certain message. For this, they\ncan use influencers, influential individuals with a significant amount of power within their network,\nwho will communicate this message to their audience (Childers, Lemon, & Hoy, 2019).\nThis means that influencer marketing heavily relies on electronic word of mouth [eWOM],\nthat is all statements made by consumers about products, services, and/or companies that are visible to\nothers through the Internet (Cheung, Lee, & Rabjohn, 2008). Research shows that eWOM is perceived\nmore positively by consumers when the message is communicated by someone that they trust (Woods,\n2016). This can be linked to influencers as they have a relationship with their followers that is mainly\nbuilt on trust (Reinikainen et al., 2020). Influencers post user-generated content – that is content that\nthey have initiated and created themselves – which is thus perceived as credible (Luca, 2015). This\ncontent can also be brand-related, for example, gaming influencers posting reviews about new games.\nDue to the influencers still being the ‘masterminds’ behind their posts, these posts will be seen as more\nauthentic (Montecchi & Nobbs, 2018). As a result, it has been proven to be very beneficial for brands\nto ask influencers to promote messages for them since these will most likely be valued more positively\ndue to their credibility and authenticity (Martínez-López et al., 2020).
2.1.2
What is influencer marketing?\nA key component for understanding influencer marketing is to formulate a clear definition of
this concept since there exist a lot of diverging definitions. When looking at older definitions of the\n7
concept, when influencer marketing was still a relatively new marketing approach, most studies\ndescribed it very broadly. Brown and Hayes (2008), for example, referred to influencer marketing as\nthe act of external individuals advising and influencing the decision-making process of the consumer.\nComparing this definition to some definitions used in newer studies in this field, the term is now often\ndescribed a lot more specifically. Chopra, Avhad, and Jaju (2020) describe it as the following:\n“influencer marketing focuses on influencers who command a mass following on digital media to\nreach the intended target audience to promote a brand’s message.” Studies from Campbell and Farrell\n(2020) and Stubb, Nyström, and Colliander (2019) take a similar approach but stress the compensation\nthe influencers receive in return for the sponsored content. Other studies, focus more on the effects of\nthe marketing technique, like Martínez-López et al. (2020) who define influencer marketing as “the\nuse of influential opinion leaders (influencers), celebrity or non-celebrity, with many followers on\nsocial platforms, to foster positive attitudinal and behavioral responses in their followers (consumers)\nregarding the brand’s interests by using posts shared on such platforms, and which also allows\ninfluencers and followers to participate in the co-creation of the brand image on social media.”.\nOverall, the various definitions do have three aspects in common, which are (1) the brand that has a\ncertain message it wants to promote, (2) the influencer who functions as an external party through\nwhich the message will be promoted, and (3) the influencer’s audience that is the target audience that\nwill receive the promotional message. That is why these three aspects all constitute the understanding\nof influencer marketing that will be used throughout this thesis.\nIn each definition, the main focus lies on the external party, as this is the influencer. This term\nin itself also consists of a wide variety of definitions. The most common definition is describing\ninfluencers as influential individuals with a large following who can affect the decision process of\ntheir audience through communicating with them (Darner & Arvidsson, 2019; Gräve, 2017). In\naddition to this, they are often seen as experts on a certain topic which is the reason for their large\nfollowing (Ferreira, 2017). For influencers to gain and communicate with this large following, using\nsocial media is an effective tool as these platforms provide the opportunity for them to easily distribute\nmessages to their (potential) audience in the form of content (Chae, 2018; De Veirman et al., 2020).\nAs a result, these influencers are usually referred to as social media influencers, which is, in general,\nthe group of influencers that comes to mind when individuals hear the term influencer (Cuevas,\nChong, & Lim, 2020; Glucksman, 2017). That is why in this thesis the term influencer will be defined\nas ‘an influential individual with a large social media following who has found their fame online and\nas a result, can affect their audience’s decision processes’. By adding the ‘online fame-origin’,\ncelebrity endorsements are excluded from the definition used in this thesis. This has to do with the fact\nthat research found that individuals can more easily relate to and identify with influencers than\ncelebrities, leading to higher levels of trust and thus consumer responses for influencers compared to\ncelebrities (Schouten, Janssen, & Verspaget, 2020; Sinning, 2019).

2.1.3
The success of influencer marketing\nAs mentioned, influencer marketing was introduced as a newer and more effective marketing
approach. The reason why it is more effective than traditional marketing approaches can best be\nexplained through the Persuasion Knowledge Model from Friestad and Wright (1994). This model\ndiscusses how individuals cope with persuasion attempts, which is done by dividing the model into\ntwo steps: (1) conceptual persuasion knowledge and (2) attitudinal persuasion knowledge (Boerman,\nVan Reijmersdal, & Neijens, 2012; Rozendaal et al., 2011). The first step refers to recognizing and\nunderstanding the advertisement and its persuasion attempt, while the second step refers to developing\na critical attitude towards the advertisement based on its credibility and trustworthiness. Influencer\nmarketing plays into this model nicely, which is why the Persuasion Knowledge Model is often\nintroduced in studies that examine the effects of influencer marketing (Coates et al., 2019; Kim &\nKim, 2020; Xin, 2019). By making the influencer the source of the message instead of the brand, it can\n‘camouflage’ the persuasion attempt (Serazio, 2018). This way, individuals are less likely to realize\nthat they are looking at sponsored content than if the content had been posted by the brand itself,\nthrough which it can be expected that they will be less critical towards this content. In addition to this,\nit has been established that influencer marketing is evaluated more positively since the relationship\nbetween an influencer and its audience is mainly built on trust (Uribe, Buzeta, & Velásquez, 2016). As\na result, this content will most definitely score higher on its credibility and trustworthiness. This way\ninfluencer marketing pushes past the main resistance techniques that individuals have built up when it\ncomes to traditional marketing approaches.\nThis success mainly depends on which influencer(s) brands choose to collaborate with. Since\nthey are going to be the external party that is communicating the message, they are the ones who\ninfluence the intensity and emotional valence of the consumers’ responses. That is why it is important\nto find the right fit between the brand, its target audience, and the influencer. First of all, the link\nbetween the brand and the influencer. Research shows that if there is a (perceived) fit between a brand\nand an influencer, this will radiate expertise and authenticity, making the sponsored content more\ncredible (Breves et al., 2019). Secondly, the link between the target audience and the influencer as\nindividuals are more likely to accept a message from someone who they like and/or identify with\n(Cialdini, 1987). This can increase the (perceived) usefulness of the sponsored content, again having a\npositive effect on consumer responses (Hjortaas & Øverås, 2018). When these two links are in place,\nthe persuasive attempt will be the most effective according to the balance theory (Heider, 1958). This\ntheory has been linked to influencer marketing in previous studies, stating that when an influencer is\nspreading positive eWOM about brand X and an individual has a positive attitude toward this\ninfluencer, this individual would then also form a positive towards brand X (Ágústsson, 2019; Jin,\nRyu, & Muqaddam, 2021). This is the main reason why it is important for brands to consider which\ninfluencer(s) they will collaborate with.

2.2
Influencer marketing on different social media platforms
2.2.1
Social media usage in the Netherlands\nThe social media landscape has changed tremendously over the last couple of years. Not only
has the number of social media users increased exponentially but there was also an emergence of new\nsocial media platforms, like TikTok and Clubhouse (Radcliffe, 2021; Shaw, 2021). Globally, there are\naround 4.2 billion social media users, with more than 1.3 million individuals joining social media\nevery day (DataReportal, 2021). In addition to this, the business model of social media platforms has\nalso developed quite rapidly as the free content that is distributed on these platforms is monetized\nmore and more by displaying advertisements and introducing marketing opportunities on the platform\n(Aydin, 2016; Farman, Comello, & Edwards, 2020).\nReports such as ‘The National Social Media Research 2021’ and ‘Digital 2021: The\nNetherlands’ have provided elaborate insights into the current social media statistics of the\nNetherlands (Kemp, 2021; Newcom, 2021). At the start of this year, it was measured that there are\ncurrently 15.1 million social media users in the Netherlands which is equal to around 88% of the entire\npopulation. On average, they spend 97 minutes per day on social media. The group 15-19 years spends\nthe most time on social media (namely 3 hours), followed by the age group 20-39 who spend almost 2\nhours on social media each day. The platforms with the most users are WhatsApp, Facebook, and\nYouTube, while the platforms TikTok, Tumblr, and Instagram are most rapidly rising. Furthermore, it\nwas found that in the Netherlands, the average number of platforms used is equal to 3.9 platforms. The\nage groups 15-19 and 20-39 even use 5.1 platforms on average.\nFrom this, it can be stated that individuals feel the need to use more than one social media\nplatform. This is because different social media platforms cater to different consumer needs. With the\nhelp of the Uses and Gratifications Theory, for each platform, an understanding can be created of why\nand how individuals use this certain platform (Madan & Kapoor, 2021). For example, YouTube and\nTikTok are mainly used for entertainment purposes as influencers can broadcast their content in the\nform of videos to a wide audience through these platforms (Riggio, 2021). Instagram, on the other\nhand, can provide a deeper insight into an influencer’s daily life since they can share all of their\nactivities through the timeline and/or Stories functionality (Van Driel & Dumitrica, 2020). Now, these\nthree social media platforms will be analyzed more in-depth based on the uses and gratifications of\neach platform and its (influencer) marketing opportunities.
2.2.2
YouTube\nYouTube was launched in 2005 serving as a platform where its users could upload and view
content in the form of videos (Burgess, 2011). In the Netherlands, YouTube has around 9.1 million\nusers. 3.1 million of them use the platform daily during which they watch over 40 minutes of content\n(eMarketer, 2020; Newcom, 2021). Here they can find a huge variety of content. On the one hand,\n10
there is professional content like music videos from artists and movie trailers by film companies. On\nthe other hand, there is user-generated content like do-it-yourself tutorials, product reviews, and vlogs\n(Andrejevic, 2009).\nAs a result, the most common motives for individuals to use YouTube are its entertaining and\neducative components (Klobas et al., 2018; Moghavvemi et al., 2018). The most common trends on\nYouTube for influencers to participate in are challenges, skits, and pranks, which all rely on its\nentertainment purposes (Jaakkola, 2018). However, some YouTubers have also gone beyond this, such\nas the Merrell Twins who have produced and acted in multiple miniseries for their channel and\nproduced a reality dating show called ‘Twin My Heart’ that is already on its third season (Spangler,\n2021). When it comes to the educative purposes of YouTube, there has been a rise in influencers that\nbase their channel on showing off their expertise, for example, Doctor Mike and LegalEagle. Both\nhave gained an audience by posting reaction videos to, respectively, medical and legal TV shows. This\nprovided a way for them to teach their audience about terms in their field of work and the accuracy of\nthe shows (Stokel-Walker, 2020a). With these types of infotainment videos, YouTubers can play\nnicely into the needs and desires of their (potential) audience (Imaniah, Dewi, & Zakky, 2020).\nHowever, there are also some interpersonal motives as co-viewing and social interaction why\nindividuals use this platform (Haridakis & Hanson, 2009; Khan, 2017). Through its newer function\nYouTube premiere, YouTubers can choose to release their video at a certain time so that it creates an\nevent where they can watch their new video together with an audience in real-time whilst\ncommunicating with them through a live chat (YouTube Help, 2021). Another option is to do a live\nstream to stimulate interaction between influencers and their audience, with some YouTubers even\ncreating a separate live stream channel for this (Horsman, 2018; Hsu, Lin, & Miao, 2020).\nOver the years, YouTube has developed into a platform where more professionally generated\ncontent can be found as advertisements became more prominent on the platform (Kim, 2012). First of\nall, there is the option for content creators to monetize their content by placing pre-, mid-, and/or postroll advertisements in their videos based on a Cost per Click or Cost per View model (Guzman, 2020).\nThe second option is to collaborate with a brand by promoting them or their products in the video, thus\nmaking the advertisement part of the content (Schwemmer & Ziewiecki, 2018). The latter is how\ninfluencer marketing takes place on this platform. Many researchers have studied the effectiveness of\ninfluencer marketing on YouTube specifically. Reijonen (2019) conducted interviews with YouTube\nusers to gain a more in-depth understanding of how they perceived advertisements and sponsored\ncontent on YouTube. While overall, the participants showed a negative attitude towards pre-, mid-,\nand post-roll advertisements, their attitude towards YouTubers making the advertisement part of the\ncontent – that is sponsored content – was neutral. The reason for this was that they believed sponsored\ncontent can be just as entertaining and useful as regular content. However, they did mention that if the\ndisclosure of the sponsorship was missing or ambiguous, this made the YouTuber come across as\ndishonest. Posting too many sponsored posts and collaborating with brands that were not perceived as\n11
a credible fit could also have this same effect. So, it was found that trust is the most important\nmediator for the sponsored content to be effective. Trust can be achieved through individuals being\ngiven the chance to turn uploading videos on the platform into a career and create an image for\nthemselves (Holland, 2016; Khamis, Ang, & Welling, 2017). As a result of this, it was found that if\nthe image of the YouTuber is in line with the ideal self-image of their audience, this would lead to a\nhigher level of trust, reasoning, and social influence of their content (Shan, Chen, & Lin, 2020). This\ncan positively affect the influencer’s credibility and thus have positive effects on content liking, brand\nattitude, and purchase intention (Rahman & Astuti, 2020; Xiao, Wang, & Chan-Olmsted, 2018).
2.2.3
TikTok\nNext up is TikTok, which is another video-sharing platform. In 2016, the platform was
introduced as a lip-syncing video application, and a year later it merged with a similar platform called\nMusical.ly (Anderson, 2020). Even though the platform is still fairly new, it has already gained lots of\npopularity (Bossen & Kottasz, 2020). There are 1.7 million users in the Netherlands, of which 0.8\nmillion use it daily (Newcom, 2021). On average, users spend more than 50 minutes per day on the\nplatform (Wallaroo, 2021). Now, there is much more content than just lip-syncing videos on TikTok,\nlike challenges, memes, and storytelling (Vizcaíno-Verdú, Aguaded, & Contreras-Pulido, 2021).\nBresnick (2019) has described the app as a ‘virtual playground’ due to its creative nature. For\nthis platform, it is useful to divide the audience into two segments when analyzing their usage motives.\nFirst of all, there is the active audience which refers to the users that create content themselves and/or\nactively interact with influencers and other users. Their main motives to use the platform would be\ncreativity, social interaction, and self-expression (Ahlse, Nilsson, & Sandström, 2020). Influencers can\nplay into this is by creating content and promoting their audience to duet with them, or choosing to use\nthe ‘duet’ and/or ‘stitch’ features themselves. These are both functionalities that can be applied by\nusers to create new content by using their own clips and combining them with an existing post from\nanother creator (Hautea et al., 2021; Medina Serrano, Papakyriakopoulos, & Hegelich, 2020). Another\noption for the influencers would be to create content that is based on reactions that they have received\nto their content. Through the ‘react’ function that TikTok offers, influencers can react to a comment in\nthe form of a video while the comment is placed in the top left corner of the video (Qiyang & Jung,\n2019). The second segment of the audience can be referred to as the passive audience, which are the\nusers that mainly use the platform to watch and like content made by others. For them, motives like\nescapism and entertainment are most likely to come into play (Montag, Yang, & Elhai, 2021; Omar &\nDequan, 2020). Like YouTube content, most videos on TikTok are created for entertainment purposes,\nwhich is why influencers rely heavily on popular trends. There is also a specific trend on TikTok that\nplays into the escapism desire. In this trend, a caption is used that starts with ‘POV:’ and then\ndescribes a situation that the viewer can imagine from their own perspective (Arzyaeva & Boiko,\n2021). The creator of the content also shows their way of coping with that type of situation. These\n12
situations could take place in a relatable setting as well as in a fictional setting like a scene from a\nmovie or TV show.\nDue to the increase in popularity of the platform, TikTok became more interesting regarding\nadvertising purposes (Choudhary, Gautam, & Arya, 2020). Advertisements can be found between\ncontent on the main feed or included in the content itself – making it sponsored content – as it is not\npossible to add pre-, mid-, or post-roll advertisements like on YouTube. (Zhang et al., 2020). As a\nresult of this, the platform gave rise to influencer marketing opportunities for brands by collaborating\nwith the biggest creators on the platform (Kennedy, 2020; Stokel-Walker, 2020b). Since the platform\nis still relatively new, there does not exist as much research on it as on other social media platforms.\nRecently, a report was launched that was based on interviews with TikTok users to gain more insight\ninto how they perceived sponsored content on TikTok (TikTok for Business, 2021). It was found that\ndue to their usage motives for the platform, users were more receptive to sponsored content that was\nnew, trend-setting, and entertaining. For this, TikTokers need to consider how to effectively make use\nof the short duration of the content as the maximum length of a video is only one minute (Hayes et al.,\n2020). Other research found that TikTokers are found to score higher on relatability as they often wear\ncasual outfits and film in front of simple backgrounds (Wang, 2020). This tends to increase the\nauthenticity of the influencer, which helps in building a trustworthy relationship with the audience and\ncan optimize product and brand awareness (Mou, 2020; Su et al., 2020).
2.2.4
Instagram\nLastly, Instagram, which was created in 2010 as a photo-sharing platform (Lee et al., 2015).
This platform has 5.9 million users in the Netherlands, of which 3.7 million use it daily with a usage\naverage of 30 minutes per day (Hootsuite, 2021; Newcom, 2021). Since its launch, this social media\nplatform has extended its features massively as it can now also be used for posting videos, live\nstreaming, shopping, and communicating with others (Musonera, 2018).\nThis has led to a variety of usage motives, although most of them have to do with some sort of\nself-indulgence motive as the platform revolves around individuals sharing what they are up to\n(Sheldon et al., 2017; Ting et al., 2015). The degree of this self-indulgence does vary between\ndifferent users. Again, we can make the distinction between active users and passive users, of which\nthe former will most likely use the platform for documentation, expression, or social interaction – that\nis through the comment section or by sending direct messages – while the latter mostly use it for\nentertainment, escapism, or due to the fear of missing out (Balta et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2015; Sheldon\n& Bryant, 2016). However, the most extreme form of self-indulgence is associated with the\ninfluencers on this platform as they use Instagram mainly for self-presentation and self-promotion\n(Duffy & Pooley, 2019). Creating an Instagram profile can help them create an online, authentic self\nthat is a reflection of their everyday life (Audrezet, De Kerviler, & Moulard, 2018; Dou, 2021). This is\nnot only the case for influencers that have Instagram as their platform of origin but also for influencers\n13
that found their fame on other platforms. YouTubers and TikTokers are often seen using Instagram to\nincrease the value and strength relationship they have with their audience (Bellavista, Foschini, &\nGhiselli, 2019; Rebelo, 2017). This way, their audience’s needs will be fulfilled as they get more\nentertaining content and can gain a more in-depth look into an influencer’s life to learn more about\nthem (Boerman, 2020).\nHaving not only influencers who have Instagram as their platform of origin but also\ninfluencers from other platforms being active on this platform, a lot of influencer marketing takes\nplace on Instagram (Jin, Muqaddam, & Ryu, 2019). Studies have shown that sponsorship disclosure is\nvery important on Instagram as this will mean that consumers will perceive the content as fair, but it\ndoes have the risk to be perceived as too commercial (Ewers, 2017; Korotina & Jargalsaikhan, 2016).\nThere exists a similar paradox for the number of followers an influencer has. It was found that\ninfluencers with a relatively high number of followers are considered more likable due to their\npopularity (De Veirman, Cauberghe, & Hudders, 2017). But, when their follower count gets too high,\nit is harder for their audience to identify themselves with the influencer (Tafesse & Wood, 2021). So,\nas Van Driel and Dumitrica (2020) stated, influencers should try to find the right balance between\nappearing authentic and still tactically approaching their audience. This can be achieved by creating\nthe online, authentic self they strive for (Newlands & Fieseler, 2020). If done correctly, the sponsored\ncontent is expected to be perceived as credible, having positive effects on content liking, eWOM\nintention, and consumers’ purchase intentions (Ki & Kim, 2019; Lee & Kim, 2020; Rebelo, 2017).
2.3
Effectiveness of influencer marketing\nLike other marketing techniques, the effectiveness of influencer marketing is often measured
based on how consumers react to it (Eelen et al., 2016; Pauwels, 2004). For brands, the goal of\npromotional content is to get consumers to like their brand, thus having them form a positive brand\nattitude, and to make the consumers enthusiastic about buying the product that is being promoted, thus\nincreasing their purchase intentions (Balakrishnan, Dahnil, & Yi, 2014; Grafström, Jakobsson, &\nWiede, 2018). In influencer marketing, this can be achieved when consumers like the sponsored\ncontent created by the influencers. That is why most studies in this field focus on how consumers react\nto the content and how this affects their decision-making process regarding a product or brand\n(Bakker, 2018; Stubb, 2019). This makes the concepts of content liking, brand attitude, and purchase\nintention the most interesting to study when it comes to the effectiveness of influencer marketing,\nwhich is why these are the three consumer responses that will be discussed in this section.\nThe first concept, that is the attitude that consumers form about the content, is often referred to\nin several ways such as advertising likeability or attitude towards ad (Riedl & Von Luckwald, 2019;\nSmit, Van Meurs, & Neijens, 2006). However, it is important to note that sponsored content consists\nof more than just its advertising component as it can also have entertaining and aesthetically pleasing\ncharacteristics (Cuevas, Chong, & Lim, 2020; Lehto, 2015). That is why, in this thesis, the term\n14
content liking is used which refers to how the consumers view and evaluate content as a whole (LoweCalverley & Grieve, 2018). The evaluation of content is based on cognitive and emotional responses\nthat consumers develop whilst viewing or examining content such as whether they believe the content\nis valuable, relevant, exciting, etcetera (Dolan et al., 2019). Based on the collection of these responses,\nan attitude – that is an overall evaluation of how much an individual (dis)likes a certain object – will\nbe formed about the content (Argyriou & Melewar, 2011). Research has found that attitudes can\ninfluence thoughts and behavior, which means that content liking can play an important role in\ninfluencing brand attitudes and purchase intentions (Park, MacInnis, & Priester, 2006).\nThe extent of the influence content liking can have, depends on the level of involvement\nconsumers feel towards the content which is determined by an individual’s motivation, opportunity,\nand ability – that is often collectively referred to as MOA (Gruen, Osmonbekov, & Czaplewski, 2005).\nThis is described in the Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion, which is a popular framework\nfor understanding how persuasion can lead to a change in consumer attitudes (Petty & Cacioppo,\n1986; Teeny, Briñol, & Petty, 2017). The theory states that there are two ways to process a persuasive\nmessage, either through the central route or the peripheral route. When an individual possesses a\nsignificant amount of MOA, they will choose the former, meaning they will look at the informative\naspect of the content critically. If this is not the case, and their MOA is therefore fairly low, they will\nchoose the latter and focus more on the aesthetics as heuristic cues to evaluate the content. This theory\nis therefore often used in the field of influencer marketing to examine the effectiveness of sponsored\ncontent through quantitative research (Lee & Kim, 2020; Lou & Yuan, 2019; Ong & Ito, 2019). It was\nfound that in the end, individuals will come to a conclusion regardless of the processing route that they\ntook. However, processing sponsored content through the central route will generally lead to stronger\nattitudes which will make them more persistent, influential, and resistant (Petty & Cacioppo, 2012).\nSo, what influences the level of MOA? In their book ‘Consumer Behavior’, Hoyer, MacInnis,\nand Pieters (2018) go over these three concepts one by one and study their determinants. First of all,\nmotivation which they define as an inner state that can move individuals towards a certain goal. They\nargue that motivation is mainly influenced by personal relevance – that is whether the content is in line\nwith an individual’s self-concept, values, needs, goals, and self-control – but also its consequences and\nif the new information is in line with previous thoughts and attitudes. Next up is the opportunity,\nwhich refers to situational factors that will determine if individuals can reach their goal, such as time\nand the information that needs to be processed. Finally, ability, which is determined by the financial,\ncognitive, physical, and social resources an individual possesses to be able to achieve a certain goal.\nOverall, the levels of these three factors will determine the processing route and thus the strength and\nemotional valence of their attitude, in which a positive attitude towards the content can be seen as a\nhigh level of content liking. So, by looking at the levels of MOA that can be expected from each social\nmedia platform and its content, the differences in processing routes and thus levels of content liking\nacross the platforms can be anticipated which will be discussed further in the next section.\n15
Now that a solid understanding of content liking has been developed, the focus will be on the\nadditional two consumer responses: brand attitude – that is the overall evaluation of a certain brand –\nand purchase intention – that is the likelihood a consumer will purchase a certain product (Sallam &\nAlgammash, 2016). Many studies have introduced brand attitude as the biggest determinant of\npurchase intention which is why they are discussed simultaneously (Abzari, Ghassemi, & Vosta, 2014;\nKudeshia & Kumar, 2017). As mentioned before, attitudes can shape individuals’ thoughts and\nbehaviors, and thus have the power to affect brand attitudes and purchase intentions. The DualMediation Hypothesis Model can help in creating an understanding of the relations between these\nthree consumer responses (see Figure 1) (MacKenzie, Lutz, & Belch, 1986; Yoon et al., 1995). That is\nwhy in previous quantitative studies regarding influencer marketing, this model has been introduced\nmultiple times (Bakar & Musa, 2020; Wärme & Olsson, 2020). As a result, it can be stated that there\nis a positive direct relationship between content liking and brand attitude, and a positive indirect\nrelationship between content liking and purchase intention. This means that once consumers have\nformed an attitude towards the sponsored content, this will influence their brand beliefs and attitude\ntowards the brand, which will, in turn, affect their purchase intentions. (Johansen & Guldvik, 2017).

2.4
Differences in influencer marketing effectiveness between social media platforms
2.4.1
Effectiveness of sponsored content per platform\nCombining the characteristics, usage motives, and marketing possibilities of the platforms that
were found in section 2.2 with the effects of influencer marketing on consumer responses as discussed\nin section 2.3, it can be expected that sponsored content will have a positive effect on consumer\nresponses on all social media platforms. This is supported by previous studies which found influencer\nmarketing to have positive effects on brand attitude and purchase intention to a certain extent (Saima\n& Khan, 2020; Xiao, Wang, & Wang, 2019; Weismueller et al., 2020). As a result, the following\n16
hypotheses regarding brand attitude and purchase intention were formulated. The reason why there are\nno hypotheses regarding content liking is that this variable was not measured in the control condition\nof the experiment as these respondents were not shown any sponsored content.
H1a. Compared to respondents in the control condition, respondents who have been exposed to\nsponsored content on YouTube have a more favorable brand attitude.\nH1b. Compared to respondents in the control condition, respondents who have been exposed to\nsponsored content on YouTube have a more favorable purchase intention.\nH2a. Compared to respondents in the control condition, respondents who have been exposed to\nsponsored content on TikTok have a more favorable brand attitude.\nH2b. Compared to respondents in the control condition, respondents who have been exposed to\nsponsored content on TikTok have a more favorable purchase intention.\nH3a. Compared to respondents in the control condition, respondents who have been exposed to\nsponsored content on Instagram have a more favorable brand attitude.\nH3b. Compared to respondents in the control condition, respondents who have been exposed to\nsponsored content on Instagram have a more favorable purchase intention.
2.4.2
Sponsored content on YouTube versus TikTok\nEven though influencer marketing has proven to be successful on all social media platforms,
research has found that there are differences in the effectiveness of influencer marketing between\nsocial media platforms since each platform has its strengths (Haenlein et al., 2020; Mallipeddi et al.,\n2020). When it comes to YouTube and TikTok, these platforms are in some ways very similar as they\nare both created as video-sharing platforms. However, the nature of the platform and the video format\ndiffer quite a lot between the two platforms. When individuals go to YouTube, the first thing they will\nsee is the home page containing videos that are recommended to them based on their watch history\n(Covington, Adams, & Sargin, 2016; Davidson et al., 2010). This means that individuals have to select\na video themselves before it starts playing. Opening TikTok, on the other hand, a video starts playing\nstraight away which is again selected through a recommendation algorithm (Liu et al., 2019). This\nvideo is then played on a loop until deciding to swipe to the next video. So, individuals will stumble\nacross content more easily on TikTok than on YouTube, which means that the threshold to watching\nvideos lies lower for TikTok. This is important because we are living in an attention economy – that is\nthe continuous activity of paying, getting, or seeking attention (Warzel, 2021). As a result, on\nYouTube individuals actively have to make a choice by having to select a video that is recommended\nto them, while on TikTok this is not the case as they do not know what video they will scroll to next.\nDue to this, individuals might be more motivated to pay attention to the YouTube content as they\nchose to watch this content, meaning they are more likely to process the information from the video\nthrough the central route (Le, Robinson, & Dobele, 2020). On the other hand, when individuals do not\n17
feel the need to watch a certain video on YouTube, there is no opportunity at all to process the\ninformation. Comparing this to TikTok, where individuals do not necessarily have to be motivated to\npay attention as they only have to scroll through the platform, it is more likely that TikTok content is\nprocessed via the peripheral route (Santoso et al., 2020). However, even if individuals do not feel the\nneed to watch certain content on TikTok, they might still be exposed to it which provides an\nopportunity to process (some of) the information.\nRelated to this, is the difference in length of the content. YouTube videos have an average\nlength of 11.7 minutes, even though it was found that a length of 6 to 8 minutes is ideal, and can go up\nto 12 hours (Tankovska, 2021). This is a lot longer than TikTok videos, which have an average length\nof 16 seconds and a maximum length of 1 minute (Slee, 2020). This makes it easier for YouTubers to\nprovide a lot more information about the product or brand that is being promoted, which can again go\none of two ways. On the one hand, YouTubers have more time to create an authentic narrative and\nraise the credibility of their sponsored content compared to TikTokers. Adding to this, the length of\nthe content is more visible on YouTube than on TikTok, so users know better what to expect\nconcerning the amount of time they will spend watching the content and be prepared for this. On the\nother hand, the amount of information and length of the content can also be perceived as\noverwhelming, which could interfere with the individual’s choice to watch and/or actively process a\ncertain video on YouTube. Whereas on TikTok, the length of the content is much shorter, so users are\nless likely to get overwhelmed on this platform.\nTaking all of this into consideration, there are differences to be expected in content liking,\nbrand attitude, and purchase intention when it comes to sponsored content on YouTube and sponsored\ncontent on TikTok. However, since both platforms have their advantages and disadvantages, it is\ndifficult to settle on a direction of this difference. This led to the following hypotheses.
H4a. Content liking differs between the YouTube condition and the TikTok condition.\nH4b. Brand attitude differs between the YouTube condition and the TikTok condition.\nH4c. Purchase intention differs between the YouTube condition and the TikTok condition.
2.4.3
Transferring sponsored content to Instagram\nSince there are already so many differences between YouTube and TikTok, even though the
platforms are fairly similar at first sight, this could mean that an even bigger difference can be\nexpected when content from YouTube or TikTok is transferred to Instagram. Compared to YouTube\nand TikTok, Instagram started as a photo-sharing platform but has extended to being compatible for\nuploading video content as well. Still, most sponsored content is uploaded in the form of photos (Feng,\nChen, & Kong, 2020; Glucksman, 2017; Veissi, 2017). So what could be the effects of this?
18
The nature of the platform has some similarities to TikTok as well as YouTube. When\nopening Instagram, individuals are immediately shown content on their timeline which is shown to\nthem until they decide to scroll to the next post. However, whereas on TikTok this is the case for both\nthe feed that includes content from people that individuals follow and the feed that consists of content\nthat is recommended to them, on Instagram this is only the case for the feed containing people that\nthey follow (Simpson & Semaan, 2021; Weimann & Masri, 2020). Recommended content on\nInstagram can be found on the explore page, which has similarities with YouTube’s recommendation\npage as content has to be selected to take a closer look at it (Agung & Darma, 2019). On the other\nhand, since most content on Instagram is posted in the form of a photo, individuals can still see the\ncontent to a certain extent even when not choosing to click on it. This would mean that due to the\naccessibility of content on Instagram, the threshold to watching content would lie lower than on\nYouTube but slightly higher than on TikTok.\nAnother important factor to take into consideration when transferring content to Instagram\nwould be the change in information richness. On Instagram, all of the information has to be provided\nthrough text form in the caption, instead of in speaking form through a video which is possible on\nYouTube and TikTok (Zhan, Tu, & Yu, 2018). For this, it is thus important to know whether or not\nInstagram users are likely to read the entire caption of every post they come across. What was found\nwas that the congruence between photo and caption is the most important determinant for this,\nmeaning that if the photo catches an individual’s attention they are more likely to check out the\ncaption to see if they find it interesting as well (Bashari & Fazl-Ersi, 2020; Kruk et al., 2019). Since\nInstagram captions can only take up to 2200 characters, it does put a limit on the inclusion of all\nnecessary information in the caption whilst still creating an authentic narrative (Brown & Tiggeman,\n2020). This can be compared to how the length of the content on TikTok puts a limit on the amount of\ninformation that will be provided. In addition to this, if a caption is longer than 12 words, it would\nrequire individuals to scroll down and/or having to click ‘read more’ to be able to read the entire\ncaption (Tiggeman, Anderberg, & Brown, 2020). This could result in not everyone reading the entire\ncaption and thus not receiving all of the information through the sponsored content. Furthermore,\nstudies have shown that for some individuals reading is more beneficial for the comprehension and\nretention of information compared to listening (Brown, 2006). However, this does depend on the\nindividual, as contradictory results also have been found (Suggate et al., 2013). Taking everything into\naccount, it is to be expected that transferring sponsored content from either YouTube or TikTok to\nInstagram will thus result in a change in the amount of the information richness of the content.\nCombining this with the platforms’ threshold of watching and thus the level of processing the\nsponsored content, changes in consumer responses are to be expected when transferring sponsored\ncontent originating from YouTube and TikTok to Instagram. Again, it is difficult to settle on a\ndirection of these effects, which is how the following hypotheses were formulated.
19
H5a. Content liking differs between the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored\ncontent on YouTube and the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored content that\nwas transferred from YouTube.\nH5b. Brand attitude differs between the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored\ncontent on YouTube and the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored content that\nwas transferred from YouTube.\nH5c. Purchase intention differs between the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored\ncontent on YouTube and the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored content that\nwas transferred from YouTube.\nH6a. Content liking differs between the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored\ncontent on TikTok and the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored content that was\ntransferred from TikTok.\nH6b. Brand attitude differs between the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored\ncontent on TikTok and the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored content that was\ntransferred from TikTok.\nH6c. Purchase intention differs between the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored\ncontent on TikTok and the condition in which respondents are exposed to sponsored content that was\ntransferred from TikTok.
In the end, once the original content has been transferred to Instagram, the only difference\nwould be whether this sponsored content was created by YouTubers or TikTokers. So far, no distinct\ndifferences have been found between the effectiveness of YouTubers compared to TikTokers. Since\nthe sponsored content in both cases has been transferred and thus adapted to the same platform – that\nis Instagram – the sponsored posts will most likely have the same effects on consumer responses,\nresulting in the following final hypotheses.
H7a. Content liking does not differ between the condition in which respondents are exposed to\nsponsored content that was transferred from YouTube and the condition in which respondents are\nexposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok.\nH7b. Brand attitude does not differ between the condition in which respondents are exposed to\nsponsored content that was transferred from YouTube and the condition in which respondents are\nexposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok.\nH7c. Purchase intention does not differ between the condition in which respondents are exposed to\nsponsored content that was transferred from YouTube and the condition in which respondents are\nexposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok.

Method\nThis chapter describes the research design of this quantitative study, explaining the different
conditions and how the stimuli were chosen for these different conditions. This is followed by a\ndescription of this study’s procedure, sampling plan, and operationalization. Lastly, the analysis of the\ndata is explained which will be executed in the following chapter.
3.1
Research design\nTo answer the research question “To what extent are YouTubers and TikTokers achieving
similar levels of content liking, brand attitude, and purchase intention when transferring their\nsponsored content to Instagram?”, an experiment was conducted consisting of a 2x2 factorial design\n(see Table 1). Since this research question studies causal relationships between variables, experimental\nresearch would be the most effective to compare differences between the conditions (Neuman, 2014).\nExperiments make it possible to collect data through which the hypotheses that were formulated can\nbe tested, thus making this approach more insightful to form an initial overview of the relationship\ncompared to a qualitative method such as in-depth interviews which could later provide a way to\nexplore the ideas and reasonings behind these outcomes (Johnson, 2011). The dependent variables that\nwere tested were the three consumer responses: content liking, brand attitude, and purchase intention.\nThe influence of two independent variables on them needed to be tested, namely the platform of origin\n(YouTube vs. TikTok) and content transference (original content vs. transferred content).\nThis resulted in four experimental conditions, with each experimental condition consisting of a\nform of sponsored content as a stimulus. The respondents in condition 1 were shown a YouTube\nvideo, while the respondents in condition 2 were shown an Instagram photo related to this YouTube\nvideo. The same goes for conditions 3 and 4, but here the platform of origin was TikTok. So, the\nrespondents in condition 3 were shown a TikTok video, while the respondents in condition 4 were\nshown an Instagram photo related to this TikTok video. In addition to this, there was a control\ncondition in which no sponsored content was shown. This made it possible to check whether or not the\ndifferences in consumer responses between the conditions were caused by the platform of origin\nand/or the transference of content. Respondents were randomly assigned to one out of these five\nconditions. The content of the experiment will be discussed further in the following section.

Procedure
3.2.1
Experiment outline\nThe experiment was completely constructed in English – that is the questions as well as the
materials – and was created in Qualtrics (see Appendix B) so that it could be easily distributed online.\nEven though there are limitations when it comes to Internet-based experiments – for example,\nrespondents not being able to directly ask questions, the limited length of the experiment, and lower\nresponse rates – it would still make sense to do it this way as online content is being studied. By doing\nso, the sponsored content is shown in such a way that it mirrors how the content is shown on the social\nmedia platform it originates from. The only difference was that the surroundings that the content was\nplaced in in the experiment were not identical to where individuals would find the content in an\neveryday browsing situation. However, as a result, no other content from the platform was shown or\ncould be accessed, meaning that this could not distract from the sponsored content that respondents\nhad to focus on. So, this way the setting was more representative and it increased the external validity\n(Rice et al., 2017). Before the actual experiment started, all respondents were shown an introductory\ntext through which they were informed about the topic of the experiment – that is their opinion\nregarding the Nintendo Switch – but were not told the actual purpose of the experiment to guarantee\nvalid results. Also, a consent form was included, emphasizing that their participation would be\nanonymous and voluntary, meaning that they could drop out at any time during the experiment. Once\nthey agreed to participate in the experiment, the target audience checks were shown to them. This way,\nthe respondents that did not meet the requirements, were filtered out immediately. The respondents\nthat did fit the target audience, were then shown two questions regarding their demographics. After\nthis, the respondents were randomly divided into one of the five conditions.\nThe respondents in conditions 1 to 4 were first shown the sponsored content that belonged to\ntheir condition. Here, the continue button did not appear immediately so that the respondents could not\ncontinue until they had had the opportunity to carefully examine the content. To improve the validity\nfurther, two checks were introduced. An attention check, which made sure that the respondents paid\nattention to the sponsored content by asking what game was included in the content. This was\nfollowed by a manipulation check which was there to be sure that the respondents noticed the\nmanipulation, asking them if the content that they had seen originated from the platform Instagram,\nTikTok, or YouTube. After this, their levels of content liking, brand and product attitude, and purchase\nintention were measured. Lastly, some control variables were included that could potentially influence\nthe dependent variables as well. These were questions about whether the respondents were familiar\nwith the product, owned the product or any close substitutes, were familiar with the influencer or\ncontent, and if they followed any influencers.
22
The control condition, on the other hand, did not include any content. That is why the\nrespondents were first asked if they were familiar with the product and if so, how they knew about the\nproduct. Then, their levels of brand and product attitude, and purchase intention were measured with\nthe same scales as in the experimental conditions. Since they were not shown any sponsored content,\ntheir levels of content liking could not be measured in this condition. Finally, an open question was\nused to gain more insight into why they did or did not have any interest in the product. In the end, all\nrespondents were shown the same ending screen, where there was room to leave a comment.
3.2.2
Materials\nAs mentioned, in all four experimental conditions, the respondents were asked to answer some
questions based on sponsored content that was shown to them. Since experimental research is all about\ncontrol, the aim was for the chosen stimuli to be as similar as possible. First of all, this meant that the\ninfluencers needed to have as much in common as possible. As a result, for both platforms of origin,\ntwin influencers were chosen: the Merrell Twins who have almost 6 million subscribers on YouTube,\nand the Caleon Twins who have 3.5 followers on TikTok. Not only do they have very similar\nappearances – both of them being identical twins, being the same age, and having similar features like\nhair and eye color – but they are also very similar based on their content and statistics regarding their\nplatforms of origin. Both the Merrell Twins and the Caleon Twins have a following of over 1 million\nwhich makes them mega-influencers (Gómez, 2019). Also, both have received an overall grade of B+\non Social Blade (n.d.), an online tool that tracks statistics surrounding social media presence. This\ngrade is based on, among other things, average view counts and engagement levels. On their accounts,\nthey mainly focus on producing entertaining and relatable content. This is also their main influence for\nthe sponsored content that they post, with the Merrell Twins having collaborated with brands like\nDisney and Nordstrom, and the Caleon Twins with Samsung and L’Oréal Paris (Barnett, n.d.).\nThe second requirement, was for the content itself to be as similar as possible. To achieve this,\nit was important to find sponsored content that was created by these influencers in partnership with the\nsame brand. This brand became Nintendo – a video game company – with the Nintendo Switch being\nthe promoted product (Van den Berg & Lagerholm, 2020). What was more challenging, was to find\nsponsored content of these influencers that was comparable in length as it was established that this is\nthe main difference between the platforms YouTube and TikTok. With regard to the sponsored content\nthat was found, the Merrell Twins’ video was 27 minutes long, while the Caleon Twins’ video was\nonly 12 seconds long. To ensure the stimulus material was more similar in length, the YouTube video\nwas cut to a certain extent. Since it was found that the ideal length of a YouTube video is around 6 to\n8 minutes, but can also be less if all information can be included in a smaller time-space, the aim for\nthe length of the content that was going to be used in the experiment became 3 to 5 minutes (O’Neill,\n2020). However, it was important that the video still contained the main essence of the original\ncontent. Since the concept of the original video was for it to show Nintendo’s new game, Animal\n23
Crossing, not only through the Nintendo Switch but also in a real-life setting, the parts that were used\nwere: the introduction of the video, the sponsorship disclosure, the influencers’ personal experience\nwith Nintendo, a creation in the game followed by this creation in real life, and finally a quick\nsummary and the influencers’ outro to wrap up the shortened stimulus.\nIn addition to this, Instagram posts were found that were related to the original content, thus\nhaving been transferred to another platform. This way, all necessary stimuli was found, with original\nYouTube and TikTok videos for conditions 1 (see Appendix A – Condition 1: YouTube video from\nthe Merrell Twins) and 3 (see Appendix A – Condition 3: TikTok video from the Caleon Twins), and\ncontent related to this original content on Instagram for conditions 2 (see Appendix A – Condition 2:\nInstagram post related to the YouTube video) and 4 (see Appendix A – Condition 4: Instagram post\nrelated to the TikTok video). Like mentioned before, in the control condition, no content was shown\nso that the consumer responses could be measured without the interference of these manipulations.
3.2.3
Pretesting phase\nBefore the experiment was distributed, a pretesting phase was introduced. This is an important
trial and error stage before the experiment is distributed to a larger audience (Smyth, 2016). Since the\nexperiment was conducted online, these pretests were conducted over video calls. This way, the\nsetting during the pretesting phase was similar to what the official experiment’s setting would be. Not\nonly could the respondents directly ask questions they had about the experiment but their non-verbal\ncues could also be observed, resulting in a complete picture of how the respondents went through the\nexperiment.\nThe pretests were conducted on April 1st. Based on four pretests, of which two were conducted\non a desktop and two on a mobile phone, four main struggles were found. First of all, not all questions\n– especially the matrices – were shown optimally in phone view. That is why a message was added to\nthe introduction stating that the respondents could best fill in the survey on a desktop or tablet and\nwhen using a mobile phone, they could best turn the phone sideways. Secondly, for the Instagram\nposts, it occurred to me that the respondents mainly focused on the photo itself and not on the caption\nas the continue button already appeared after five seconds. Since the entire post needed to be\nexamined, as the majority of the information on Instagram is communicated through the caption, the\ntimers for these two conditions were extended to fifteen seconds. Related to this were some difficulties\nregarding the answer options from question six, asking which game was featured. Some of the\nrespondents interpreted the option ‘none of the above’ as that there was a game involved in the post,\nbut none of the games that were mentioned in the other answer options. As a result, they went for the\noption ‘I don’t know’. That is why, this answer option was replaced by ‘no game, just the Nintendo\nSwitch’.

3.2.4
Recruitment phase and final sample\nAfter these changes were made, the official recruitment process started on April 6th which
lasted for two weeks until April 20th. A recruitment message combined with the link to the experiment\nwas distributed through my personal accounts on the social media platforms Facebook, LinkedIn,\nInstagram, and WhatsApp. Additionally, the experiment was posted with the same recruitment\nmessage on three Facebook groups: Respondenten gezocht (onderzoek, enquête, vragenlijst, scriptie,\nafstudeer), Vragenlijst/Enquête RESPONDENTEN GEZOCHT/ruilen HBO/WO Studenten, and\nRespondenten gezocht!, specifically created for the distribution of surveys. In this recruitment\nmessage, the requirements for the target sample and the length of the experiment were mentioned.\nIn total, 200 valid responses were collected, of which the respondents were perfectly\ndistributed over the five conditions, resulting in 40 respondents for every condition. Of these\nrespondents, the percentage of women was equal to 87.0%, and the other 13.0% consisted of men. The\nrespondents’ age varied from 18 to 34, with an average age of 23.04 (SD = 2.41). The most named\nhighest educational level was a Bachelor’s degree (57.0%), followed by a Master’s degree (32,5%),\nand secondary school or high school (5.0%). A similar analysis was conducted for each condition. It\nwas found that there were very similar distributions among the conditions (see Table 2). The biggest\noutlier that was found was the distribution in educational levels in experimental condition 4, where\nmore respondents stated they had a Bachelor’s degree.

Sampling\nFurthermore, the formulation of a sampling plan is also critical to minimize the occurrence of
a bias within an experiment. For this, the target audience had to be defined more precisely. Since\nsocial media has especially become a common aspect of everyday life for Generation Y and Z, they\nare most likely to be targeted and affected by influencer marketing, thus making them a popular target\naudience for studies regarding influencer marketing (Kadekova & Holienčinova, 2018; Lou & Yuan,\n2019). However, since this thesis only focuses on the platforms of Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, it\nwas found that this target audience might be too broad (Viswanathan & Jain, 2013). For all three\nplatforms, the vast majority of the users belong either to the younger half of Generation Y or the older\nhalf of Generation Z (An, Kwak, & Jansen, 2017; Jang et al., 2015; Omar & Dequan, 2020). Adapting\nto this, the age of the target audience for this study should vary between 18 and 34 years old. Within\nthis age group, this study focused on individuals who are currently located in the Netherlands. Adding\nto this, it would also be important for the respondents to be familiar with at least one out of the three\nplatforms to be able to participate in the experiment. So, to check whether or not the respondents fit\nthis target audience, an age, location, and platform familiarity check were included.\nTo find a sufficient number of respondents to gather a representative of the entire population\nthat was studied, the respondents were targeted through the following sampling methods (Sarstedt et\nal., 2018). The first step was to distribute the experiment through my own social network asking my\nfollowing not only to participate in the experiment but also share the experiment amongst their social\nnetworks, resulting in snowball sampling; a non-probability sampling method. The remaining required\nresponses were collected by sending out recruitment messages on the Facebook groups that were\nmentioned before. This indicates purposive sampling as the people who follow these groups are more\nlikely to end up in the sample than those who do not.
3.4
Operationalization\nThe operationalization process in which concepts are transformed into measurable variables is
important in experimental research to assure validity and reliability (Sarstedt et al., 2018). That is why\nscales were found for all consumer responses so that these concepts could be measured optimally.\nFor content liking, the scale was taken from Chang (2005). Here, respondents were asked to\nindicate on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (= strongly disagree) to 5 (= strongly agree) to what extent\nthey considered the sponsored content to be ‘interesting’, ‘good’, ‘likable’, ‘favorable’, and ‘pleasant’.\nA factor analysis using Principal Components extraction with Varimax rotation based on Eigenvalues\n(>1.00), KMO = 0.85, χ2 (N = 160, 10) = 391.52, p < .001 found that the resultant model explained\n67.2% of the variance in content liking. The factor loadings of the individual items onto this variable\nare presented in Table 3. Additionally, through a reliability analysis, it was found that no items had to\nbe deleted to improve the reliability of the scale (Cronbach’s α = 0.88). Overall, the mean score of this\nscale was equal to 2.99 (SD = 0.88).\n26

Secondly, for brand attitude, the scale was taken from Spears and Singh (2004). Respondents\nwere asked to indicate on a seven-point semantic scale to what extent they considered the brand\nNintendo to be ‘appealing’, ‘good’, ‘pleasant’, ‘favorable’, and ‘likable’ in which a higher score would\nreflect a more favorable attitude. A factor analysis using Principal Components extraction with\nVarimax rotation based on Eigenvalues (>1.00), KMO = 0.89, χ2 (N = 200, 10) = 929.99, p < .001\nfound that the resultant model explained 81.8% of the variance in brand attitude. The factor loadings\nof the individual items onto this variable are presented in Table 4. Additionally, through a reliability\nanalysis, it was found that no items had to be deleted to improve the reliability of the scale\n(Cronbach’s α = 0.94). Overall, the mean score of this scale was equal to 5.17 (SD = 1.12). Since it\nwas also interesting to gather data on the attitude towards the product that was promoted in the\nsponsored content, this same scale was used to measure product attitude. Again, a factor analysis using\nPrincipal Components extraction with Varimax rotation based on Eigenvalues (>1.00), KMO = 0.92,\nχ2 (N = 200, 10) = 11178.18, p < .001 was conducted and it was found that the resultant model\nexplained 87.5% of the variance in brand attitude. These factor loadings are presented together with\nthe factor loadings of the variable brand attitude in Table 4. Again, the reliability analysis proved that\nno items had to be deleted to improve the reliability of the scale (Cronbach’s α = 0.96). Overall, the\nmean score of this scale was equal to 5.15 (SD = 1.16).\nTable 4. Factor and reliability analyses for brand and product attitude\nItem

Furthermore, for purchase intention, the scale was taken from Lee, Yun, and Lee (2005). Here,\nrespondents were asked to indicate on a seven-point semantic scale to what extent they considered\npurchasing a Nintendo Switch to be ‘likely’, ‘possible’, and ‘probable’ with a higher score meaning a\nmore favorable attitude. A factor analysis using Principal Components extraction with Varimax\nrotation based on Eigenvalues (>1.00), KMO = 0.77, χ2 (N = 200, 3) = 654.06, p < .001 found that the\nresultant model explained 92.2% of the variance in purchase intention. The factor loadings of the\nindividual items onto this variable are presented in Table 5. Additionally, through a reliability\nanalysis, it was found that no items had to be deleted to improve the reliability of the scale\n(Cronbach’s α = 0.96). Overall, the mean score of this scale was equal to 3.20 (SD = 1.79).

Finally, there were eight control variables in total: product familiarity, purchase consideration,\nowning the product, owning close substitutes, influencer familiarity, content familiarity, following\ninfluencers, and passing the attention check. The first four were measured for all conditions, while the\nother four were only measured in the experimental conditions as the control condition was not shown\nsponsored content from influencers. All of these variables were categorical and contained three answer\noptions, with ‘1’ indicating yes, ‘2’ indicating no, and ‘3’ indicating uncertain.
3.5
Analysis\nOnce all of the data was collected through Qualtrics, the analysis could be carried out with
SPSS (version 27). The data resulting from all five conditions were presented in one overall dataset.\nThe first step was to clean the data by removing incomplete responses and respondents that did not fit\nthe target sample or did not pass the manipulation check. The total sample consisted of 223 responses.\nAll incomplete responses were left ‘in progress’ in Qualtrics, however, to be sure, it was checked\nmanually that no responses in the dataset had any missing values. Based on this first check, no\nresponses had to be deleted from the dataset. When it came to the target sample check, it was found\nthat 3 respondents did not meet the age requirements, 12 respondents were not living in the\nNetherlands, and 2 respondents were not familiar with any of the three platforms. Finally, it was found\nthat 6 respondents did not pass the manipulation check which meant they did not notice or remember\nwhat platform the stimulus they were shown originated from, resulting in 200 valid responses.\n28
After this, the respondents were classified based on the condition they were randomly\nassigned to. To test all of the hypotheses, per dependent variable – that is content liking, brand\nattitude, and purchase intention – an ANOVA test was conducted to study the differences between the\nconditions based on its levels of consumer responses. For this, these three variables, which were\noriginally multi-item scales, were each computed into a new overall variable. In addition to this, for\nevery variable ANCOVA tests were conducted with the control variables mentioned in the previous\nsection. This way, the tests can be compared to see what effects the control variables can have but also\nif the findings that were found with the ANOVA test were stable even when adding control variables.\nThe results from these analyses can be found in the subsequent chapter.

Results\nThis chapter provides an overview of the results that followed from the experiment. First of
all, the descriptives of the background variables and consumer responses are provided. Then, the\ndifferences in consumer responses between the conditions were found through three ANOVA tests\nbased on which the hypotheses formulated in the theoretical framework can be accepted or rejected.
4.1
Descriptives of background variables and consumer responses\nThe experiment revolved around the brand Nintendo and its product, the Switch. It was found
that 91.0% of all respondents were familiar with the Nintendo Switch to a certain extent. The most\ncommon source for learning about this product was television commercials (62.5%), which was\nclosely followed by social media content (52.5%). In 85.7% of the cases, this was achieved through\ncontent on Instagram, followed by content originating from YouTube (52.4%) and TikTok (19.0%).\nBesides this, family (42.5%) and friends (30%) were common distributors of knowledge about the\nSwitch. Furthermore, 46.0% of all respondents stated that they had considered buying a Nintendo\nSwitch, while 22.5% owned a Nintendo Switch. Some motivations from individuals who bought or\nconsidered buying the product included interest in the product (42.1%), the assortment of games\nsuitable for the product (31.6%), and killing time (21.1%). On the other hand, individuals who had not\nbought the product named the product not being a good fit for them (47.4%), the fact that they\nprobably would not use it (36.8%), and the product being too expensive (15.8%) as the most common\nreasons for this. Additionally, 40.0% of the respondents claimed they owned at least one other gaming\nconsole, the most popular consoles being a PlayStation (67.5%), a Wii (26.3%), and an Xbox (23.8%).\nThe percentage of respondents that were familiar with all three platforms was equal to 68.5%,\nwith 98.5% of the respondents being familiar with Instagram, 68.5% with TikTok, and 94.0% with\nYouTube. These three platforms also turned out to be very popular for following influencers. Overall,\n85.6% of the respondents stated they followed influencers on social media, of which 96.4% followed\ninfluencers on Instagram, 24.8% on TikTok, and 67.9% on YouTube. When it came to the influencers\nthat were introduced in the experiment, 22.5% of the respondents in experimental conditions 1 and 2\nwere familiar with the YouTubers, compared to 3.8% of the respondents in experimental conditions 3\nand 4 who were familiar with the TikTokers. However, the number of respondents being familiar with\nthe content was almost equal for conditions 1 and 2 (8.8%) and conditions 3 and 4 (10.0%).\nFurthermore, there was an attention check included in the experiment (see Table 6), which\ntested if the respondents paid attention to the sponsored content by asking them which game was\nincluded in the content they had seen. Since only the respondents in experimental conditions 1 to 4\nwere shown sponsored content, there is no data on this for the control condition. Overall, it was found\nthat respondents scored better on this question when they were shown a video – which was in\nconditions 1 (95.0%) and 3 (90.0%) – compared to when they were shown a photo on Instagram –\nwhich was in conditions 2 (70.0%) and 4 (57.5%).\n30

The correct answer for each condition is indicated in bold.\nFinally, the descriptives of the three dependent variables which were content liking, brand
attitude, and purchase intention. For each variable, a separate ANOVA analysis was conducted to\nexamine whether differences were observed in the consumer responses between the different\nconditions (see Table 7). In the first ANOVA analysis that tested the concept of content liking, the\nfour experimental conditions were compared to one another since this concept could not be measured\nin the control condition due to the lack of sponsored content. The results showed a significant main\neffect for the conditions on content liking, F(3, 156) = 4.10, p = 0.008, partial η2 = 0.07. The other two\nANOVA analyses that tested the concepts of brand attitude and purchase intention, did include the\ncontrol condition as these concepts were measured across all conditions. The results showed a\nsignificant main effect for the conditions on brand attitude, F(4, 195) = 4.17, p = 0.003, partial η2 =\n0.08, as well as a significant main effect for the conditions on purchase intention, F(4, 195) = 6.61, p <\n0.001, partial η2 = 0.12. Now that it has been found that there are group differences, it would be\ninteresting to check which group differences are significant and which ones are not. This was achieved\nthrough post-hoc comparison tests, which are presented in the following section.

Hypothesis testing
4.2.1
Effectiveness of sponsored content per platform\nIn subsection 2.4.1, three hypotheses were formulated regarding the effectiveness of
sponsored content for each platform – that is YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. In the first part of\nthese three hypotheses (part a) it was tested whether compared to respondents in the control condition,\nrespondents who had been exposed to sponsored content on, respectively YouTube (H1a), TikTok\n(H2a), and Instagram (H3a) have a more favorable brand attitude. A Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons\nshowed that the mean value of brand attitude was significantly higher in the control condition (M =\n5.72, SD = 0.95) compared to not only the YouTube condition (M = 5.02, SD = 1.46, p = 0.041), but\nalso the TikTok condition (M = 4.77, SD = 1.08, p = 0.001). This led to both H1a and H2a being\nrejected since the opposite of what was stated was found. Since the respondents in both experimental\nconditions 2 and 4 were exposed to sponsored content on Instagram, these conditions were not only\ncompared separately to the control condition but also in combination. For this, a new categorical\nvariable was created, in which value ‘1’ indicated that the respondents were shown sponsored content\nfrom YouTube, ‘2’ indicated that the respondents were shown sponsored content from TikTok, ‘3’\nindicated that the respondents were shown sponsored content from Instagram, and ‘4’ indicated that\nthe respondents were not shown any sponsored content. First of all, a Bonferroni post-hoc\ncomparisons showed that there was no significant difference in brand attitudes between the control\ncondition (M = 5.72, SD = 0.95) and the condition in which YouTube content was transferred to\nInstagram (M = 5.18, SD = 0.89, p = 0.272), as well as the condition in which TikTok content was\ntransferred to Instagram (M = 5.18, SD = 0.95, p = 0.258). This was followed by an independent\nsamples t-test which was conducted with this new condition variable, through which it was found that\nthe mean value of brand attitude was significantly higher in the control condition (M = 5.72, SD =\n0.95) compared to the Instagram conditions (M = 5.19, SD = 0.91), t(118) = 3.02, p = 0.003. This\nmeant that H3a was also rejected since the opposite of what was anticipated was found.\nThe second part of these three hypotheses, denoted as the b-hypotheses, focused on whether\ncompared to respondents in the control condition, respondents who had been exposed to sponsored\ncontent on, respectively, YouTube (H1b), TikTok (H2b), and Instagram (H3b) have a more favorable\npurchase intention. A Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed that the mean value of purchase\nintention was significantly higher in the control condition (M = 4.41, SD = 1.89) compared to not only\nthe YouTube condition (M = 2.96, SD = 1.80, p = 0.002), but also the TikTok condition (M = 2.71, SD\n= 1.51, p < 0.001). This led to H1b and H2b both being rejected as again, the opposite of what was\nstated was found. The second half of the third hypothesis was tested similarly to the first half by\ncomparing experimental conditions 2 and 4 to the control condition separately as well as by combining\nthem. A Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed that the mean value of purchase intention was\nsignificantly higher in the control condition (M = 4.41, SD = 1.89) compared to the condition in which\n32
YouTube content was transferred to Instagram (M = 3.07, SD = 1.57, p = 0.005), and the condition in\nwhich TikTok content was transferred to Instagram (M = 2.84, SD = 1.69, p = 0.001). This was\nconfirmed through an independent samples t-test which was again conducted with the new condition\nvariable. Here, it was found that the mean value of purchase intention was significantly higher in the\ncontrol condition (M = 5.72, SD = 0.95) compared to the Instagram conditions (M = 5.19, SD = 0.91),\nt(118) = 3.02, p = 0.003. So, again, this meant that H3b was rejected based on the fact that the opposite\nof what was stated was found.
4.2.2
Sponsored content on YouTube versus TikTok\nIn the following subsection of the theoretical framework, the differences between sponsored
content on YouTube and TikTok were discussed. Based on this, one hypothesis that consisted of three\ncomponents was formulated. The first part of this hypothesis tested whether content liking differed\nbetween the YouTube and the TikTok condition (H4a). A Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed\nthat there the mean value of content liking was higher in the YouTube condition (M = 2.97, SD = 1.03)\ncompared to the TikTok condition (M = 2.63, SD = 0.83, p = 0.455). However, this difference was\nfound not to be significant which led to H4a being rejected.\nThis was followed by the hypothesis’ second component which studied whether brand attitude\ndiffered between the YouTube and the TikTok condition (H4b). Through a Bonferroni post-hoc\ncomparisons it was observed that the mean value of brand attitude was higher in the YouTube\ncondition (M = 5.02, SD = 1.46) than the TikTok condition (M = 4.77, SD = 1.08, p = 1.000). Again,\nthis difference was not significant. So, as a result, H4b was rejected as well.\nFinally, the last part of the hypothesis examined whether purchase intention differed between\nthe YouTube and the TikTok condition (H4c). Here, a Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed that\nthere also the mean value of purchase intention was higher for the YouTube condition (M = 2.96, SD =\n1.80) than for the TikTok condition (M = 2.71, SD = 1.51, p = 1.000). Like the other parts of\nhypothesis 4, the difference was found not to be significant. This meant that H4c was rejected too.
4.2.3
Transferring sponsored content to Instagram\nAfter the differences between sponsored content on YouTube and TikTok had been discussed,
the theoretical framework was extended by examining the potential effects of transferring this content\nto Instagram. Based on this three final hypotheses were formulated, of which the first one focused on\nthe effects of transferring YouTube content to Instagram. This was done by dividing the hypothesis\ninto three components, each component focusing on one consumer response. The first component of\nthis hypothesis tested whether content liking differs between the condition in which respondents were\nexposed to sponsored content on YouTube and the condition in which respondents were exposed to\nsponsored content that was transferred from YouTube (H5a). For this, a Bonferroni post-hoc\ncomparisons was used through which it was found the mean value of content liking in the condition in\n33
which respondents were exposed to sponsored content on YouTube (M = 2.97, SD = 1.03) was lower\nthan in the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred\nfrom YouTube (M = 3.27, SD = 0.69, p = 0.665). However, it was found that this difference was not\nsignificant which meant that H5a was rejected.\nThe second component of the hypothesis tested the difference in brand attitude across the two\nconditions to find out whether brand attitude differs between the condition in which respondents were\nexposed to sponsored content on YouTube and the condition in which respondents were exposed to\nsponsored content that was transferred from YouTube (H5b). Again, a Bonferroni post-hoc\ncomparisons showed that there was no significant difference, even though the mean value of brand\nattitude in the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content on YouTube (M =\n5.02, SD = 1.46) was lower than in the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored\ncontent that was transferred from YouTube (M = 5.18, SD = 0.89, p = 1.000). So, H5b was also\nrejected.\nIn the final component of this hypothesis, it was tested whether purchase intention differs\nbetween the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content on YouTube and the\ncondition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from YouTube\n(H5c). Through a Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons it was found that even though the mean value of\npurchase intention in the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content on\nYouTube (M = 2.96, SD = 1.80) was lower than the mean value of purchase intention in the condition\nin which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from YouTube (M =\n3.07, SD = 1.57, p = 1.000), this difference was not significant. This led to H5c being rejected as well.\nThe sixth hypothesis that was formulated is almost identical to the previous one as it consists\nof the same three components, but instead of examining sponsored content on and from YouTube, the\nfocus was now on TikTok. This means that the first component tested whether content liking differs\nbetween the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content on TikTok and the\ncondition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok\n(H6a). A Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed that the mean value of content liking in the\ncondition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content on TikTok (M = 2.63, SD = 0.83)\nwas lower than the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was\ntransferred from TikTok (M = 3.09, SD = 0.81, p = 0.094), but this difference was not significant. This\nmeant that H6a was rejected.\nThe following component tested whether brand attitude differs between the condition in which\nrespondents were exposed to sponsored content on TikTok and the condition in which respondents\nwere exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok (H6b). Again, a Bonferroni posthoc comparisons showed that even though the mean value of brand attitude in the condition in which\nrespondents were exposed to sponsored content on TikTok (M = 4.77, SD = 1.08) was lower than in\nthe condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from\n34
TikTok (M = 5.18, SD = 0.95, p = 0.927), this difference was not significant. So, this led to H6b being\nrejected as well.\nThrough the final component of this hypothesis, it was tested whether purchase intention\ndiffers between the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content on TikTok and\nthe condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from\nTikTok (H6c). Here, a Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed that the mean value of purchase\nintention was lower for the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content on\nTikTok (M = 2.71, SD = 1.51) than for the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored\ncontent that was transferred from TikTok (M = 2.84, SD = 1.69, p = 1.000). However, this difference\nwas found not to be significant which meant that H6c was also rejected.\nThe seventh, and final, hypothesis that was formulated focused on the two Instagram\nconditions to find out if there was a difference in consumer responses for sponsored content that was\ntransferred from YouTube and sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok. To test this, again\nthe hypothesis was split up into three components. The first component tested whether content liking\ndid not differ for the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was\ntransferred from YouTube and the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content\nthat was transferred from TikTok (H7a). A Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed that even though\nthe mean value of content liking in the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored\ncontent that was transferred from YouTube (M = 3.27, SD = 0.69) was higher than in the condition in\nwhich respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok (M = 3.09,\nSD = 0.81, p = 1.000), this difference was not significant which resulted in H7a being accepted.\nNext, the second component tested whether brand attitude did not differ for the condition in\nwhich respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from YouTube and the\ncondition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok\n(H7b). Here, a Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed that there was no significant difference\nbetween the mean value of brand attitude in the condition in which respondents were exposed to\nsponsored content that was transferred from YouTube (M = 5.18, SD = 0.89) and the condition in\nwhich respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok (M = 5.18,\nSD = 0.95, p = 1.000). This led to H7b being accepted as well.\nFinally, the last component of this seventh hypothesis tested whether purchase intention did\nnot differ for the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was\ntransferred from YouTube and the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored content\nthat was transferred from TikTok (H7c). Here, a Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons showed that the\nmean value of purchase intention for the condition in which respondents were exposed to sponsored\ncontent that was transferred from YouTube (M = 3.07, SD = 1.57) was higher than for the condition in\nwhich respondents were exposed to sponsored content that was transferred from TikTok (M = 2.84,\nSD = 1.69, p = 1.000). Since this difference was not significant, this resulted in H7c being accepted.\n35
4.2.4
Adding control variables\nAfter all tests were conducted, for all three dependent variables (content liking, brand attitude,
and purchase intention) several ANCOVA tests were conducted through which it could be examined\nwhether or not the findings were stable even when adding these control variables. In the method\nsection, eight control variables were introduced, which were product familiarity, purchase\nconsideration, owning the product, owning close substitutes, influencer familiarity, content familiarity,\nfollowing influencers, and passing the attention check. For this last control variable, a new dummy\nvariable was created named ‘attention check’, with value ‘0’ indicating that the respondent had not\npassed the attention check and ‘1’ indicating that they had passed the attention check. Since all of the\ncontrol variables are categorical variables, they were included as random factors. Each ANCOVA test\nwas run by only adding one control variable. However, as the four control variables influencer\nfamiliarity, content familiarity, following influencers, and passing the attention check were not\nmeasured in the control condition as these respondents were not shown any sponsored content, these\ncould not be used as control variables for the concepts of brand attitude and purchase intention.\nFor content liking it was found that there was only a significant main effect of owning close\nsubstitutes (F(1, 3.09) = 17.89, p = 0.023, partial η2 = 0.85). For brand attitude, significant main\neffects were found of product familiarity (F(1, 5.86) = 10.58, p = 0.018, partial η2 = 0.64) and\npurchase consideration (F(1, 4.00) = 7.77, p = 0.049, partial η2 = 0.66). Finally, there were significant\nmain effects found for purchase consideration (F(1, 4.00) = 15.12, p = 0.018, partial η2 = 0.79) and\nowning the product (F(1, 4.01) = 6.78, p = 0.060, partial η2 = 0.63) on purchase intention. However,\nall of these effects did not lead to any changes regarding the hypothesis being rejected or accepted.
4.3
Summary of results\nTo conclude, not all of the hypotheses that were formulated in the theoretical framework were
accepted. All of hypotheses 1 to 3 were rejected, even though a significant difference was found. This\nis because this significant difference was the exact opposite of what was anticipated. Instead of an\nincrease in consumer responses compared to the control condition, all experimental conditions showed\na decrease in brand attitude and purchase intention. Regarding hypotheses 4 to 6, there were indeed\nsome differences between the experimental conditions which included sponsored content on different\nplatforms. However, due to these differences not being significant, all of these hypotheses had to be\nrejected as well. Finally, for hypothesis 7, which compared the two experimental conditions which\nincluded the sponsored content that was transferred from the platforms of origin, again no significant\ndifferences were found. Since this was anticipated, this led to this hypothesis being the only one that\ngot accepted in its entirety. An overview of this summary can be found in Table C1 (see Appendix C).

5.
Conclusion and Discussion\nThis chapter starts by summarizing the findings of the experiment to formulate an answer to
the research question. This is followed by discussing these findings. In addition, this study’s relevance,\nlimitations, strengths, and recommendations for future research will be elaborated upon.
5.1
Conclusion\nIn the introduction chapter of this thesis the following research question was formulated to
investigate the effectiveness of sponsored content being transferred from the platform of origin to\nInstagram: “To what extent are YouTubers and TikTokers achieving similar levels of content liking,\nbrand attitude, and purchase intention when transferring their sponsored content to Instagram?”. It was\nstated that YouTubers and TikTokers would be deemed successful in transferring content when\nachieving similar or higher levels of content liking, brand attitude, and purchase intention for the\ntransferred sponsored content compared to the sponsored content on the platform of origin. Overall,\nthere were no differences found in any of the consumer responses between the conditions, which\nmeans that YouTubers and TikTokers are successful in transferring their sponsored content to\nInstagram. So, when these influencers would post sponsored content on either their platform of origin\n(either YouTube or TikTok) they can anticipate similar levels of content liking, brand attitude, and\npurchase intention as if they post sponsored content on another platform like Instagram. However, it\nwas also found that instead of a rise in consumer responses compared to the control condition in which\nno sponsored content was shown, all experimental conditions showed a decrease in brand attitude and\npurchase intention. This means that influencer marketing negatively affects content liking, brand\nattitude, and purchase intention, which is in contrast with previous studies concerning influencer\nmarketing that have found that it should have positive effects on these consumer responses (Müller,\nMattke, & Maier, 2018; Tafesse & Wood, 2021). In the subsequent section, possible explanations for\nthese findings and insignificant differences can be found.
5.2
Discussion of findings\nOverall, the majority of the hypotheses were rejected based on the fact that no significant
differences were found. The main reason for this might be the sample size of the experiment as it is\neasier to find significant results with larger samples (VanVoorhis & Morgan, 2007). In the end, 200\nvalid responses were collected in total. This number can be seen as relatively small compared to the\nactual size of Nintendo’s (potential) target audience. As a reference, the average global number of\ngamers in 2020 was equal to around 2.7 billion (Clement, 2021). Furthermore, there could be some\nother factors that might have influenced the outcomes. In the following subsections, the hypotheses\nwill be discussed more in-depth by grouping them based on the consumer response that they tested.\nFirst off, the hypotheses regarding content liking will be discussed (H4-7a), which will be followed by\nthe hypotheses regarding brand attitude (H1-3a and H4-7b) and purchase intention (H1-3b and H4-7c).\n37
5.2.1
Content liking\nFour hypotheses regarding content liking across the four experimental conditions have been
introduced (H4a, H5a, H6a, and H7a). When testing these hypotheses it was found that compared to\nTikTokers, YouTubers scored higher on content liking not only through sponsored content on their\nplatform of origin but also on Instagram. In addition to this, it was found that when transferring\nsponsored content from the platform of origin to Instagram, this resulted in higher levels of content\nliking for the YouTubers as well as the TikTokers. However, none of these findings turned out to be\nsignificant. This meant that the findings were not in line with what was anticipated as in the theoretical\nframework it was stated that differences in information richness of sponsored content from different\nplatforms would lead to changes in content liking. This could be explained by the multi-item scale that\nwas used to measure content liking. Four out of the five items from this scale focused on the\naesthetical and entertaining purpose of the content (‘good’, ‘likable’, ‘favorable’, and ‘pleasant’) while\nonly one of them focused on the informational aspect of the content (‘interesting’). This does not mean\nthat an inadequate scale was chosen, as the purpose of the scale was to measure the attitude towards\nthe sponsored content as a whole, thus including its aesthetic and entertaining aspects. However, since\nthe anticipation of differences in the level of content liking was solely based on the information\nrichness of the content, it would make sense that only measuring this with one item would not result in\nsignificant differences. So, it might have been better to use a larger scale consisting of more items so\nthat multiple factors within the scale could be detected. This way the distribution of items evaluating\nthe form of the content and the message of the content will be more even. Combining these factors\nwould then give a solid overview of content liking as a whole, but could also be analyzed separately.\nIn addition to this, in the theoretical framework, factors like the length of the content and\nthreshold of watching were discussed which are harder to measure in an experimental setting. This\nmeant that respondents did not have to choose what content they deemed interesting enough to watch\nout of a selection of content. However, it can be stated that the respondents were still motivated\nenough to watch the content as they chose to click the continue button instead of dropping out of the\nexperiment. Related to this was the fact that it was established that the differences between the\nplatforms based on these factors – that is length, accessibility, and information richness of the content\n– could all lead to positive as well as negative results. As stated in the theoretical framework, this is\nwhat made it hard to predict the directions of these hypotheses. This could then mean that each factor\ndid lead to differences in content liking across the platforms, but since these effects were in opposite\ndirections, they canceled each other out leading to there being no significant differences between the\nlevels of content liking across the different conditions.
38
5.2.2
Brand attitude and purchase intention\nAs mentioned before, brand attitude and purchase intention are closely related, which is
confirmed through the findings of this experiment as similar trends have been found for these two\nvariables. That is why the hypotheses regarding these variables will be discussed simultaneously.\nFirst of all, hypotheses 1 to 3 studied the effects of being shown sponsored content on a social\nmedia platform, that being either YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram, compared to having seen no\nsponsored content on the levels of brand attitude and purchase intention. Here, significant results were\nfound, however, the hypotheses were still rejected as the opposite of what was anticipated was found.\nThis means that the levels of brand attitude and purchase intention were significantly lower when\nhaving been exposed to sponsored content than having seen no content. As stated earlier, this is in\ncontradiction with findings from previous studies (Müller, Mattke, & Maier, 2018; Tafesse & Wood,\n2021). Throughout this thesis, it was established that influencer marketing relies heavily on trust and\nthe relationship between an influencer and their audience. This level of trust might not have been\npresent in this experiment. From the results, it can be stated that the majority of the respondents were\nnot familiar with the influencers. So, the missing relationship between the influencer and the\nrespondents could have negatively affected the effectiveness of the sponsored content. For example,\nresearch has found that individuals are more likely to accept a message from an influencer when they\nbelieve that the influencer is someone who shows expertise or is someone that they like (Hjortaas &\nØverås, 2018). This means that if an individual does not feel a connection with an influencer, this can\nlead to them not accepting the influencer’s message which thus negatively affects their levels of brand\nattitude and purchase intention. Apart from this, not being familiar with an influencer could also affect\nthe perceived fit between an influencer and a brand. When an individual does not know if the\ninfluencer is actually a fan of the brand they are promoting, as this is the first time they are seeing\ncontent from them, this might make the content come across as less authentic. Comparing this to if\nthey were to be familiar with the influencer, chances are that they often see content – sponsored and\nnon-sponsored – from this influencer about the brand which would make the fit between the influencer\nand brand more credible. This high level of congruence and involvement with the brand will help the\ninfluencer create an authentic narrative, which has a positive effect on brand attitude as well as\npurchase intentions (Feng, Chen, & Kong, 2020; Torres, Augusto, & Matos, 2019; Von Mettenheim &\nWiedmann, 2021).\nFurthermore, parts b and c of hypotheses 4 to 7 also tested the concepts of brand attitude and\npurchase intention. Since these concepts are influenced by content liking, it would make sense that the\nfactors described in subsection 5.2.1 also explain the insignificant findings regarding these hypotheses.\nHowever, not having significant differences could have also been caused by other factors that were not\nmeasured as it is important to note that brand attitude, and thus purchase intention, can be affected by\nmore than just content liking. Research shows that the effects of sponsorship disclosure language can\nhave on brand attitude (Evans et al., 2017; Lee & Kim, 2020). Overall, it was found that individuals\n39
perceive sponsored posts containing clear disclosures as more honest due to their transparency\ncompared to ambiguous disclosures which might raise a dubious feeling (Lou, Tan, & Chen, 2019). In\nturn, this transparency results in a stronger relationship between influencers and their audience, having\npositive effects on brand attitude (Dhanesh & Duthler, 2019). The disclosure of sponsored content can\nbe thus be seen as a way to boost source credibility (Lim et al., 2017). The sponsorship disclosures of\nthe sponsored content used in the experiment did vary across the experimental conditions. The\nYouTube video started with the message ‘This video is sponsored and approved by Nintendo’. This\nwas supported by the YouTubers thanking Nintendo for sponsoring their video in the in- and outro of\ntheir video. The TikTok video, on the other hand, did not include a sponsorship disclosure, which\nmight have led to this sponsored content scoring the lowest on brand attitude and purchase intention.\nFinally, both the YouTubers and TikTokers started the caption of their sponsored content on Instagram\nwith #ad and ended with #nintendoswitch. This could be seen as a less extreme disclosure compared to\nthe one from the YouTube video, without it becoming ambiguous since this is a common way for\ninfluencers to indicate that their Instagram post is sponsored (Boerman, 2020; Nordmann, 2019).
5.3
Implications\nIn the introduction, it was stated that this research would hold great scientific and societal
relevance and this has proven to be the case. First of all, like mentioned in the last section, this study\nfocused on sponsored content as a whole instead of just the message or advertising aspect of the\ncontent as is commonly done in similar studies (Haenlein et al., 2020; Lou & Yuan, 2019).\nAdditionally, the idea was introduced that brands can use multiple social media platforms at the same\ntime for collaborations with influencers, thus not having to look for and choose the most effective\nplatform. The effects of the sponsored content – either original or transferred – on the three consumer\nresponses were measured through an experiment so that the differences in consumer responses could\nbe compared easily. Through this, it was found that sponsored content can be as effective on the\nplatform of origin as on another platform like Instagram. Also, dividing influencers based on their\nplatform of origin did not result in any significant differences either which is in contrast with what was\nfound in previous studies (Haenlein et al., 2020; Sinning, 2019). As mentioned in section 1.2 of the\nintroduction, these assumptions resulted from qualitative studies and were not yet backed up with\nquantitative research such as an experiment. Now, this thesis shows that even though it is rational to\nexpect differences in consumer responses between the social media platforms Instagram, TikTok, and\nYouTube, these differences are not (yet) present in a real-life setting. All of this taps into the gaps of\nprevious research in this field.\nEven more so, this study is very interesting for societal stakeholders, of which the implications\ncan be divided into two categories of stakeholders. First, for influencers, the effects of content\ntransference on content liking are the most interesting. No significant differences were found between\nthe levels of content liking for content on the platform of origin and the content that was transferred to\n40
Instagram. There was a slight increase in content liking when the sponsored was transferred, even\nthough it was not deemed as significant. From this, influencers learn that when they adapt their content\nwell to this other platform, they can expect similar or even greater levels of content liking. With this\ninformation, they know how influential their content can be in regards to consumer responses that are\nbeneficial to brands. Something else influencers can take away from this study is related to their\naudience. Over the years, they have gained a lot of knowledge about growing their audience on their\nplatform of origin, but they have to figure this out again when using other platforms like Instagram. It\nis possible, and might be more interesting, to attract a different audience on this other platform than on\ntheir platform of origin. This way, when promoting a certain product or brand on both platforms, they\ncan reach different people, resulting in a bigger organic reach. However, a different audience does\nrequire gaining knowledge on how to make content interesting for this specific audience, which will\npotentially differ from what the influencer has learned from their platform of origin.\nNext up are brands, who will mainly benefit from the findings regarding the effects of content\ntransference on brand attitude and purchase intention. It is interesting for them to learn that the\nsponsored content of influencers is just as effective on their platform of origin as on another platform\nthe influencer is active on, like Instagram. This way, they know that it is beneficial to pay more money\nfor additional exposure on a second platform as this content will be evaluated just as effectively and\ncan thus lead to a bigger organic reach. For them, it is also interesting to know whether an influencer\nhas an overlap in audience across the platforms. Having the same audience on both platforms or\nhaving two different audiences both have their advantages. For example, having two (partially)\ndifferent audiences will result in a bigger reach as the combined audience is larger (Campbell &\nFarrell, 2020). However, having the same audience will result in this audience being targeted twice as\nthey are shown the sponsored content on both platforms. According to the mere exposure effect, being\nexposed to sponsored content more than once can have positive effects on consumer responses\n(Montoya et al., 2017; Yagi & Inoue, 2018).
5.4
Limitations, strengths, and directions for future research\nThe main limitations of this study result from section 5.2. First of all, the scale of content
liking, which did not measure the informational component of the sponsored content optimally. It\nwould have been interesting to use a larger scale for content liking consisting of multiple factors, for\nexample, multiple items measuring the entertaining value of the sponsored content, the attitude\ntowards the aesthetics, the uniqueness of the post, and how informative the message was. This can be\nachieved by adding additional items to the scale that was used in this experiment which mainly\nfocused on its entertainment value. Sheinin, Varki, and Ashley (2011) introduced scales for the\nnovelty (Cronbach’s α = 0.87) and usefulness (Cronbach’s α = 0.78) of advertisements which can be\napplied to sponsored content as well. The scale of novelty includes items as ‘original’, ‘memorable’,\nand ‘visually interesting’, while the usefulness consists of the items ‘believable’, ‘relevant’, and\n41
‘practical’. All items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (= strongly disagree) to 7\n(= strongly agree), but this can be turned into a 5-point Likert scale to match the scale that was used\nfor content liking in this thesis. Doing so would make it possible to draw conclusions about content\nliking as a whole, but also about how these different aspects were valued separately. Furthermore, in\nthe results section, it was found that not a lot of respondents were familiar with the influencers. As\ninfluencer marketing relies heavily on trust, it would have been more compelling to have an even\ndistribution among the experimental conditions of individuals who were not familiar with the\ninfluencers and those who were. This could have been achieved by spreading the experiment across\nthe influencers’ followers in addition to my network and/or the Facebook groups. As a result, within\nthe experimental conditions, it would be possible to compare the consumer responses of the\ninfluencers’ followers to those of the ‘non-followers’. Also, it would have been useful to include\nquestions regarding the influencer’s familiarity, trust, expertise, similarity, perceived transparency, and\nhonesty, since these factors can heavily influence the effectiveness of influencer marketing as stated in\nsubsection 5.2.2. A final limitation would be that there was no data collected on the sponsorship\ndisclosures which would have been a nice additional control variable. A check for noticing the\ndisclosure could have been introduced similarly to the attention and manipulation checks.\nIn addition to the scientific and societal relevance this paper holds, some other strengths are\nthe fact that valid scales were chosen as their Cronbach’s alphas all varied between 0.88 and 0.96\nwhich indicates that the scales scored relatively high on the internal consistency of its items (Gliem &\nGliem, 2003). Also, the materials that had been chosen were proven to be very well-founded. First of\nall, the sponsored content was actual content that was created by influencers in collaboration with a\nbrand, so not just for research purposes. Additionally, the manipulation in the content was very\nnoticeable as everyone had passed the manipulation check. Finally, from the results section, it became\nclear the chosen stimuli from the YouTubers and TikTokers were very similar in regards to their levels\nof content liking. Since there were no significant differences between experimental conditions 1 and 2,\nwhich included sponsored content created by YouTubers, and experimental conditions 3 and 4, which\nincluded sponsored content created by TikTokers, it can be stated that the influencers are indeed very\nsimilar in the content that they produce. So, this means that these two sets of twins are very relevant\nfor studies that investigate the differences between YouTube and TikTok as platforms of origin.\nAnother strength would be the inclusion of the attention and manipulation checks, both providing\ninformation on how well the respondents paid attention to the content that was shown to them. As\nmentioned, everyone passed the manipulation check which meant that they did recognize the platforms\neven in an experimental setting. What was noticeable, however, was that the attention check had\nrelatively high passing rates for experimental conditions 1 and 3 which were both videos that\nincorporated the product. Experimental conditions 2 and 4 on the other hand, which contained the\nInstagram posts, had much lower passing rates which could indicate that not all individuals are likely\nto read captions on Instagram.\n42
Future research on this topic can take several directions. Building further on this study’s\nlimitations and their solutions, the final conclusion of this thesis can be checked and defined more\nprecisely. It is also interesting to run a similar experiment for another industry than the gaming\nindustry, as influencer marketing might be more or less effective for different industries. According to\nSocialBook (2019), tech is included in the top 5 industries that can benefit from influencer marketing,\nbut the most suitable industries were found to be fashion, beauty, and travel. A potential difference\nbetween these industries is that for gaming products individuals are most likely interested in product\nspecifications and quality, while for products related to fashion, beauty, and travel it is more about the\nvisualizations. Since individuals are looking for a different type of information in these other\nindustries, this could result in the emergence of differences in consumer responses across social media\nplatforms as content in the form of a video can show more of a product than a photo on Instagram can\nfor example. Of course, this topic can also be broadened in multiple ways. This study just focused on\nInstagram content in the form of a photo. However, due to its newer functions (IGTV, Reels, and\nStories), sponsored content in the form of a video is now also possible on Instagram. It would be\ninteresting to see what kinds of results this could have for transferring content. The IGTV function on\nInstagram, namely, is suitable for longer videos similar to YouTube while using Reels is applicable for\nshorter content which makes this function almost identical to TikTok. So, does this mean that\nYouTubers can best transfer their entire video to Instagram using IGTV, or should they upload a\nhighlight video of this video and post it as a Reel? Also, since Stories are disappearing after 24 hours,\nhow useful is this function to transfer content to the platform? The content transference can also be\ntaken further by including additional platforms like Twitter, or even by examining YouTubers’ content\non TikTok and the other way around. The options are endless and thus worth exploring in the future.\nHowever, for now, a solid understanding of content transference has been formed which will act as a\nfirm foundation for future research on the effectiveness of influencer marketing. It can be stated that\n‘seeing double’ will in fact lead to levels of content liking, brand attitude, and purchase intention that\nare just as effective across different social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
