Abstract\nIn 2016, news about a British data marketing firm called Cambridge Analytica\nstarted to surface in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The firm was\naccused of covertly harvesting Facebook users’ data and crafting special advertisements that\nwould appeal to those users during political campaigns. The news cycle, at the time, started\nto decrease as the politician that was linked to the news and the firm, Ted Cruz, has failed to\nwin the Republican Party’s nomination for the US presidential election in 2016.\nIn 2018, the Cambridge Analytica name made a strong comeback to the news after\nChris Wylie, Cambridge Analytica’s director of research, -as he describes his role in the\nfirm, and the scandal’s whistle-blower accused his firm of manipulating millions of voters in\nthe UK during the Brexit referendum and the U.S. during the presidential elections in 2016.\nThis manipulation, according to Wylie, was done by creating targeted ads that helped the\nVote Leave and the Trump 2016 campaigns to maliciously,gain political victory by deceiving\nvoters in these two countries. This act of deceiving was done by the ads containing,\naccording to Wylie, fake news. While this might seem as a since-fictional claim, this claim\ngoes in line with the claim Cambridge Analytica made about itself, as a company that is able\nto alter audience behavior.\nThis study is an attempt to analyze and provide an account of the persuasion\ntechniques that these ads contained. By underscoring these techniques, readers would be\nbetter able to identify such sophisticated ads and/or news.\nThis is a comparative study that relied on existing research and literature in different\ndisciplines and linked the components that were known about these types of ads, political\ncommunication, populism and online disinformation. The combination these elements have\nprovided a clear guide to explore this understudied area. Moreover, this study was conducted\nby using qualitative research methods through the triangulation of multi-modal rhetorical\nand thematic analysis to investigate 50 Facebook ads/posters, and 20 television ads used by\nthe Vote Leave Campaign in the UK and the Trump 2016 Presidential Campaign in the U.S.,\nand compared the results of the persuasion techniques of both campaigns.\nThe results suggest that both campaigns used highly similar persuasion techniques\nand strategies in crafting their ads, however, this similarity was also highly contextual.
Keywords: Cambridge Analytica, Brexit, Trump, fake news, persuasion techniques.

Introduction
Beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance. (George Bernard\nShaw 1856-1950).
In Western democracies, the use of disinformation on social media networks in\npolitical campaigns by populist politicians has triggered (political) communication scholars,\ngovernmental and non-governmental bodies to investigate this phenomenon, especially after\nthe United Kingdom (UK) voted Leave during the Brexit referendum in 2016, and Donald J.\nTrump becoming the 45th president of the United States (U.S.) in the same year. While\ndisinformation is not a new strategy in political communication and campaigning (Allcott and\nGentzkow, 2017 as cited in Zhou and Zafarani, 2018), observers and scholars gave it special\nattention due to the short and long term devastating effects it has on democracy, particularly,\nafter accusing the two campaigns of using citizens’ (voters’) data on social media to predict\ntheir political tendencies (Scott, 2018), and thus, made it easier for both campaigns to appeal\nto what concerns voters the most (Cadwalladr, 2017).\nDisinformation, or what is commonly, yet erroneously, referred to as ‘fake news’,\nseemed to strongly serve populist politicians in reaching their goals in terms of gaining\npolitical power in some countries, while it did not have the same effect in others (Norris and\nInglehart, 2019). The varying effectiveness of disinformation is due to its reliance on several\nfactors. Factors such as historical developments (e.g., the recent immigration crisis in Europe\nand the fears of a religious, cultural or ethnic transformation that might follow), fluctuating\neconomic performance, growing unemployment rates, etc. seemed to be more concerning to\nthe people in some countries, but also some generations within these countries were more\nconcerned about these issues (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). A very prominent demonstration\nof the difference in effectiveness of the disinformation strategies can be found in the victory\nof the two aforementioned campaigns in the UK and the US, but its failure, as of the moment\nthis research was done, in other Western democracies like the Netherlands and France. More\nillustrations will follow in the following section.\nHistorically, military coups, or other forms of use of force, were the key cause\nfor subverting democracies worldwide. Nowadays, however, it is elected officials, namely\npopulists, with intentions of subverting “the very process that brought them to power”\n(Levitsky and Ziblatt, 2018, p.4) that possess real threat to democracies, i.e., through the
6
ballot box. This may lead to severe consequences, causing democracies to fail due to populist\npoliticians not respecting the, back then, unwritten, yet widely consented values of\ndemocratic practices and conventional wisdom (Levitsky and Ziblatt, 2018; Norris and\nInglehart, 2019). For example, deceiving voters (disinformation, and employing social\nnetworks to spread it). This objective with the intention to hold power in a country starts as\nearly as the political campaign of the politician (candidate) or the political party (Norris and\nInglehart, 2019).\nPopulist politicians, such as Donald Trump in the US, and Boris Johnson, the current\nPrime Minister of the UK and leader of the Vote Leave Campaign in the Brexit referendum,\ntended to heavily rely on sensationalist and false news to achieve their political endeavors\n(Rose, 2017; Norris and Inglehart, 2019). In 2016, both Johnson and Trump, adopted a clear\nanti-establishment rhetoric by channeling their focus on criticizing the entire political system\nin their own countries and by attacking other countries and blaming them for hurting their\nown countries’, among others, economic performance (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). The term\nsystem here refers not only to the political establishment, but also to the internal economic,\ncultural, and social establishment, and the country’s external relationships with other\ncountries and bigger political and economic bodies (such as the United Nations, the European\nUnion, The World Trade Organization, etc.). This anti-establishment rhetoric was\nencapsulated in the Vote Leave Campaign’s slogan “Let’s Take Back Control” (Virdee and\nMcGeever, 2017 p. 1804) that implied a lack of sovereignty. Moreover, this antiestablishment rhetoric adopted by pro-Brexit politicians had a significant consequence on the\neffectiveness of the Vote Leave Campaign and led to the electoral victories not only in the\nBrexit case, but also put the European political establishment/s at stake (Hobolt, 2016; Norris\nand Inglehart, 2019). Similarly, one of the Trump Campaign 2016 slogans #DrainTheSwamp\nwas focused on attacking the political and economic system in the country’s Capital,\nWashington D.C., and the economic capital, Wall Street. Draining the swamp Trump was\nreferring to is the corruption that he accused lobbyists of in order to define an enemy he\nconstantly attacked during his campaign. (Lahitou, 2016).\nAfter the UK voted to leave the EU and, parallelly, Trump being elected president of the US,\nallegations discrediting the practices of the two campaigns started to surface. Accusations of\nrelying heavily on sensational news and disinformation led the British Parliament\n(https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-andsport/Fake_news_evidence/Vote-Leave-50-Million-Ads.pdf) and the US Senet\n(https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf) to\n7
launch formal inquiries to investigate both the Vote Leave Campaign and the Trump 2016\ncampaign for creating political ads that contain false, and out-of-context news and/or\ninformation to persuade their voters and gain political victory (Cadwalladr & Glendinning,\n2018); readers in this paper is used interchangeably with the terms voters, audience and\ncitizens. This use of disinformation was considered to be an outrageous abuse of new\ntechnologies in democratic societies, even if these practices were not at the time, regulated or\nrestricted (Norris and Inglehart, 2019).\nAs a general rule, rhetoric and rhetorical techniques do not only signify a campaign’s\nand/or a political movement’s political tendencies, but also are some of the main factors that\ndetermine its success or failure depending on how it will resonate with the people (voters)\n(Fallis, 2017). Although readers (voters) are usually critical about the information they\nreceive from media and their voting behavior is a more complex process which is not only\ndetermined by the quality of the political campaign, rhetoric can. Resilient emotional appeals,\nfor example, are in some cases capable of changing readers’ minds about controversial issues\n(Fallis, 2017).\nThe analysis of the rhetorical appeals in political advertisements, especially during\npolitical campaigns, may not be as strait forward as it may seem. The complexity of decoding\nthe political messages, in political ads, by different people, is derived from the accumulation\nof many layers of personal knowledge, beliefs, cultural or ethnic background etc. that shape\nthe audience (readers) understanding. Accordingly, the interpretation of a media message\ndecoded in the content a reader consumes, remains, disproportionately, individualistic on its\nown right. Therefore, one way or another, the targeted audience of the political ads play a\nrole in the creation of these ads, as the content creators aim at producing advertisements that\nwould resonate with and influence their voting decisions.\nTaking online disinformation into account, the two analyzed cases in this thesis are of\nhigh significance due to them both being the first campaigns known to target voters on social\nmedia networks by using their own information and mobilize them. This significance is also\nderived from the allegations of covertly hiring a firm - Cambridge Analytica, to collect\nFacebook users’ data (voters), analyze it, and designing advertisements that appeal to them\nmost based on predefined voter’s segments that resulted from the analysis of the collected\ndata (Cadwalladr & Glendinning, 2018; Scott, 2018). This heavy use of false news\n(disinformation) by both campaigns played a pivotal role in mobilizing people to vote for the\ntwo campaigns and was an integral part of their rhetoric in the two campaigns (Rose, 2017).\nDisinformation in this project, as will be revisited in the next chapter, refers to false\n8
information (news) that intends to cause harm and/or personal gain for the creator’s own\nbenefit.\nOne of the other significances of the two campaigns, is that their leaders had strong\nideological ties and similarities. On of the similarities between the two campaigns in terms of\nideology, the Vote Leave, as part on the bigger Leave movement that included several other\ncampaing, and the Trump 2016 Campaign, Wilson (2017) signifies these similarities as\nfollows: it was common between both campaigns to refute and underestimate experts’\nopinions on important matters (e.g., the human effect on global issues such as global\nwarming); both campaigns were xenophobic and promised to reduce immigration from other\ncountries, especially Muslim countries; both campaigns were hostile towards international\nbodies (the EU in the UK case, and the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in\nthe Trump 2016 case); finally, both campaigns put enormous effort in the nationalistic\nappeals (the UK once more a global power outside the EU, and “Make America Great\nAgain”).\nIn 2016, Barack Obama, the former president of the U.S. was on a visit to the UK,\nand while he was in press conference with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, and\nObama urged the British people to vote remain in the EU, describing that the EU as a source\nthat magnifies the British global power (Wilson, 2017). Similarly, Nigel Farage, the back\nthen leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), member of the European\nParliament and leader of the Leave.eu organization went to the U.S. to support Trump in his\nrallies (Wilson, 2017), signifying the struggle between two wings in the two countries, one\nfighting to keep the global and national political-establishment, and the other fighting to\nchange it.\nIn 2015, Donald Trump was awarded the Lie of the Year Award by Politifact, an\nonline factchecking platform (Wilson, 2017). Trump’s claims that were described by the\nplatform as false news (disinformation) or inaccurate includes: Muslim Americans were\ncheering during the collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11th 2001; the majority of\nwhite Americans were murdered by African Americans; and, that the Mexican government\nencouraged its citizens with criminal backgrounds to enter the U.S. (Wilson, 2017). Similar\nfalse and racial allegations were made by the Vote Leave Campaign before the Brexit event\n(Wilson, 2017).\nIntrigued by the similarities between both campaigns in terms of being led by rightwing populist politicians, sharing many ideological values, and, most importantly, being
9
accused of employing disinformation as a tool to persuade voters on social media, the\nfollowing research question was developed:
In their political communication advertisements, how similar were the persuasion\ntechniques between the Vote Leave Campaign advertisements in the United Kingdom with the\nTrump Presidential Campaign in the United States in 2016?
This research question was broken down into four sub-questions. This was due to my\ndecision to analyze not only Facebook advertisements of both campaigns, but I decided to\ninclude television commercials, assuming that it will enrich the outcome of this thesis by\nexamining a different type of advertisements.\nTo answer the sub-questions, I had to form four groups in which Facebook\nadvertisements and TV commercials would fall in to represent a campaign (Vote Leave or\nTrump 2016). The groups I formulated contained two groups to represent the Vote Leave\ncampaign, and two groups to represent the Trump 2016 Campaign.\nThe four sub-questions are as follows:\n1- What were the persuasive techniques of the Vote Leave Facebook advertisements\nduring the Brexit Vote Leave Campaign in 2016? (Group-one).\n2- What were the persuasive techniques of the Trump campaign Facebook\nadvertisements during the U.S. presidential campaign in 2016? (Group-two)\n3- What were the persuasive techniques of the Brexit Vote Leave Campaign TV\ncommercials in 2016? (Group three)\n4- What were the persuasive techniques of the Trump campaign national TV\ncommercials during the U.S. presidential elections 2016? (Group four)\nThe main focus of this thesis, as will be more elaborated, was on persuasive techniques and\nnot only on the rhetorical appeals, which was one out of several other dimensions of the\nanalyses conducted.\n1.1
Social and scientific relevance\nThe use of disinformation news in political campaigns to triumph elections or
referenda may not be a new phenomenon, the use of new communication technologies in\nspreading disinformation, however, is. The threat of employing disinformation in political\ncampaigns extends beyond subverting democracies. One of its characteristics that it,\ninherently, and to various degrees, feeds political polarization among citizens in a given
10
democracy (Tucker et al., 2018), which may severely harm a democracy on the long term\n(Levitsky and Ziblatt, 2018).\nSchmidt (2017) also considered phenomena such as Trump and Brexit to possess\nserious threat to democracy and democratic political establishments, not only in the countries\nwhere these events took place, but also to other countries, namely in Western societies that\nmight take the same path. While many political science scholars consider the Brexit case to\nbe an outlier in Europe and EU countries (Hobolt, 2016) i.e., likely will not be replicated;\nothers, however, forewarned of other possible negative scenarios that may happen in other\ndemocracies due to the use of disinformation on social media networks (Schmidt, 2017).\nNoticeably, a gap in the study of rhetorical and persuasion techniques related to\nsocial media disinformation, populism, and the Brexit and Trump campaigns 2016 exists.\nWhen it comes to studies of rhetoric in the events of Brexit and Trump 2016, most studies I\nfound focused more on one event, or compared Trump against Hillary Clinton -former\nSecretary of State, and Trump’s opponent in the American presidential elections in 2016 (see\nSavoy, 2018); or a content analysis of the Twitter supporters of Trump and Brexit (see\nLeidig, 2019); or just conducted a rhetorical analysis of Trump’s presidential speeches (see\nLahti, 2018). Additionally, due to what new communication technologies offer in terms of\ndata collection about users (Cadwalladr & Glendinning, 2018), and how politicians may hire\nsuch companies to covertly provide analyses about voter-political-tendencies based on the\nbig-data they collect about users in a given country, the study of rhetorical and persuasion\ntechniques of these events may provide an account, and potentially be useful to scholars\nstudying populist rhetoric and/or developing online automated disinformation and/or populist\nspeech detection on social media networks. Moreover, after what is known as the Cambridge\nAnalytica scandal, and the EU regulated data collection, social media platforms constantly\ndevelop ‘legal’ ways to continue collecting users’ data.\nAdvertisements crafted in relation to the Cambridge Analytica scandal are known to\njournalists as dark ads (Cadwalladr, 2017). The dark ads were the Vote Leave Campaign\nadvertisements that were crafted by psychologists related to Cambridge Analytica and\ntargeted voters in the UK based on what they thought would appeal to the readers most, with\nthe intention of persuading them to ‘vote leave’ out of the EU (Cadwalladr, 2017). On the\nother hand, the British Parliament final report on the scandal refuted the term ‘fake news,’\nand named these ads as disinformation ads (House of Commons, 2018).\nSimilarly, the Trump presidential campaign 2016 was accused of using corresponding\ntechniques to urge voters to vote for Trump (Rose, 2017; Cadwalladr, 2017). Therefore, this\n11
study aimed at analyzing the persuasion techniques that were implemented in these ads that\nwere described as a sort of disinformation advertisements designed to deceive voters to gain\npolitical victory by the two campaigns during the two events of Brexit and the US\npresidential elections in 2016.\nDue to the lack of research on these two cases in terms of analyzing the persuasion\ntechniques used during the two campaigns, this research is exploratory in nature. By\nexploratory it is meant that the aim of this research is to learn more about the persuasion\ntechniques that were used by the two campaigns in their disinformation advertisements as\nthis, at the time, was a completely a new phenomenon that is still not fully understood.\nThis research is socially relevant for detailing how online disinformation became\nwidely used in political campaigns, namely, political campaigns related to the far-right and\npopulist movements or politicians (Schmidt, 2017). Additionally, because people are not\nable, most of the time to recognize and spot online disinformation (Alphilippe et al., 2019)\nreading such research may increase their understanding of how content is designed by\nrecognizing the appeals that such groups focus on, even if the content does not have any\ndirect reference to them, especially in times of major political campaigns (e.g., the current\nPresidential election in the U.S.).\nFinally, this research is potentially, professionally relevant to those who work on\nonline disinformation detection and machine learning by providing an account of the used\npersuasion techniques in the two campaigns. For example, Zhou and Zafarani (2018) called\nfor studying rhetorical appeals in online disinformation. Although their call was initially to\nstudy it using quantitative research methods, as mentioned earlier, this study, at least in the\nEnglish language, remains the first about these two important campaigns.

Theoretical framework\nDemocracy is sustained not only by institutions but by culture. (Author unknown).
The theoretical framework section in this thesis is divided into two main parts. Part\none reviews the difference between the two cases -Vote Leave and the Trump Campaign\n2016, in terms of the political-cultural differences and historical background, which in turn\nreflects on how political media messages are crafted. Part two reviews political\ncommunication, including the design of political advertisements, with special focus on online\ndisinformation and the populist rhetoric that was used in the creation of the advertisements in\ntwo campaigns.\nIn general, this chapter reviews the main concepts that are related to the research\nquestion of this thesis.
2.1
Part one\nIn this part, I underscore the aims of this comparative study and some of the relevant
differences between the UK and the US that played a role in the interpretation of the sample.
2.1.1 Cross-national comparative studies\nConducting cross-national comparative studies has different intentions. In this study, I\nfollow the guidelines set by Livingstone (2003). Livingstone (2003) notes that such studies\nshould mention explicitly their aims such as: to improve the understanding of other countries;\nto examine a theory in different settings or contexts; “examine transitional processes across\ndifferent contexts, […] improve international understanding […]” (p. 479). Choosing these\nreasons are justified as follows. Britain leaving the EU, and Trump wining the presidential\nelections in the US in 2016 has raised concerns of the repetition of the same scenarios in\nother Western democracies such as France, the Netherlands and Italy in Europe (Schmidt,\n2017). Furthermore, Schmidt (2017) observed that populists in the UK and in the US in 2016\nhave been “Using rhetorical strategies and ‘uncivil’ language in a ‘post-truth’ environment\nthat rejects experts and mainstream media, they [populists in the UK and the US] have\nreshaped the political landscape by framing the debates in new ways while using new and old\nmedia […]” (p. 249). Thus, the rhetorical analysis, in its multimodal form, of both campaigns\ncan deepen the understanding of the populists’ persuasion techniques in those two unique\ncases.\n13
Brader (2005) found that emotional appeals in political campaigns’ ads have the\ncapacity of changing voters’ behavior in different events of democratic nature. This study\naimed at analyzing the persuasive techniques in the political ads and commercials before the\ntwo studied campaigns and one of the main focuses is the emotional appeals of these political\nmessages. Also, comparative studies have the capacity to safeguard scholars from falling into\nfalse conclusions such as generalizing findings from one country in one period of time to\nother countries with different contexts and at different time periods by rendering the main\ndifferences between the countries understudy (De Veerse, 2017). On the other hand, crossnational comparative studies have been long criticized because of epistemological\nassumptions, for example, making a unified methodology and expecting it to fit different\ncontexts leading scholars to fall into a common mistake known as “measurement out of\ncontext” (p. 482) by denying every country of its “cultural specificity” (Livingstone, 2003\np.482). In this study, special attention was given to cultural specifics of the two countries\nstudied and shortly, some of the main differences will be underscored. Nevertheless,\nhowever, if the conceptualization is too specific that it can only be understood in its own\ndistinctive context, comparison studies become redundant as it becomes impossible to draw\nconclusions about the studied cases anymore (Livingstone, 2003). Therefore, it is crucial to\nnote the relevant differences between the two contexts with special attention for the\nsimilarities as well.\n2.1.2 The UK vs. the US as different cases\nWhile the US and the UK are two of the oldest democracies that exist in modern\nhistory, they have different ways of holding democratic events. For example, the United\nKingdom is a direct democracy where the votes of its citizens are counted directly towards\nwhom/what is being voted for/on (Menselshon & Parkin, 2001). Furthermore, the Vote Leave\nCampaign sample that was analyzed in this project is a campaign for a referendum, which has\ndifferent campaigning logics from a presidential campaign (LeDuc, 2000). For example -and\nnot limited to- referenda are events where voters vote on a topic, while presidential election\nvoters vote for a person (LeDuc, 2000). Also, it is important to note here that the Brexit event\nwas an unbiding referendum (Siddique, 2016; Norris and Inglehart, 2019), however, the\nresults were respected by British politicians (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). This difference\nmakes the focus in a referendum on convincing voters on ideas or topics in favor of a certain\npolitical group, and in a presidential election, the campaigning is mainly focused on\nconvincing voters to vote for their candidate by putting the candidate in a positive and
14
desirable leader role (LeDuc, 2000). Additionally, the US is a representative democracy, at\nleast in presidential elections, where citizens vote for delegates that would make decisions on\ntheir behalf (LeDuc, 2000) through what is known as The Electoral College.\nPopulist rhetoric in political campaigns, especially in elections, tend to adopt what is\nknown as the personalization of politics. That is, impersonating a populist movement in a\nperson or a leader (Block & Negrine, 2017). As will be reviewed latter, this seemed to be the\ncase in the Trump Campaign by drawing the image of Trump to be the person that will\n“Make America Great Again”. On the other hand, this is not the case in the Leave Campaign,\nat least from the sample analyzed, as the focus was to convince the British to ‘vote leave’ out\nof the EU and the use of personalization was minimal.\nOther differences between the two cases were visible after Schmidt (2017) conducted\nwhat she called discursive institutionalism analysis. That is, an interdisciplinary approach to\nanalyze institutionalized discourse, especially, the political discourse. In a recent study,\nSchmidt (2017) applied this methodology to analyze the institutionalized discourse in both\nthe British and American cases related to the two main events of the Brexit referendum and\nthe US presidential elections in 2016. Schmidt (2017) found and noted important common\nand different features in the two events and the general atmosphere surrounding them. To\nillustrate, building on the notion that neoliberalism is well established in both the US and the\nUK since the 1980s, she argues that both cases were common in attacking the, back then,\ncurrent political establishment. And while both countries share, among others, the same\neconomic philosophy, both campaigns took different stances on the effects of neoliberal\npolitical and economic policies (Schmidt, 2017). For example, Trump attacking the -back\nthen- current political and economic establishment by attacking neoliberal policies, on the\nother hand, the Leave Campaign remarkably avoided to capitalize on people’s anger from\nsuch policies (Schmidt, 2016 as cited in Schmidt, 2017). Therefore, while both campaigns\naligned to a large extent in their ideology, they had their own differences in terms of which\nagenda-issues to discuss with their voters.\nFinally, it is noteworthy that while the differences between the two campaigns are\nclear in the way they function, these differences did not pose an obstacle for the study aims.\nFirst, because of the strong personal and ideological connections between the leaders of both\ncampaigns as mentioned in the introduction, and second, is that the study looked at the\nphenomenon form its populist, and use of disinformation on social media networks angles.\nThus, not only did comparing the two cases deepened the understanding of the recent populist\nrhetorical techniques, but also the two different types of campaigns resulted in providing a\n15
wider picture of the persuasion techniques used in disinformation on social media networks\nas a strategy to persuade voters.\n2.1.3 Cultural differences between the UK and the US\nAccording to Hall (2013), in order for a culture to exist, members of this culture must,\nto various degrees, share the same cultural codes, which entails sharing, broadly speaking, the\nsame language. Language here refers not only to the spoken language consisting of words,\nbut also refers to the assemblage of other sorts of transmitting meaning such as sounds, facial\ngestures and expressions (body language), symbols, color codes (such as in the traffic lights\nand how every color refers to a distinct meaning), etc. (Hall, 2013). Furthermore, members of\nthe same culture, are able to, roughly speaking, interpret ‘things’ or ‘words’ in the same way,\nunder the assumption that they share the same “conceptual maps” (p. 4) of things or concepts\n(Hall, 2013). In addition, due to the constant change of the use of language (meaning of\nthings), culture also changes (Hall, 2013). For example, the use of words used to connotate\nonly ‘something negative’ in a past era such as ‘wicked’ or ‘sick’ can be used to express\napproval and admiration of something and that it is ‘beyond limits’ among specific cultural\ngroups (Hall, 2013).\nWhile the cultural differences between the two countries, in a sociological sense, can\nbe useful, because of how it plays a role in shaping discourse, it was out of the scope of this\nstudy, and the focus was on the cultural differences that relate more to the political practices\nin them. This was due to two reasons. First, it was done as an attempt to narrow the focus on\nhow culture might play a role in making political decisions in the two campaigns when\nexamining the sample. Second, it was an attempt to contextualize the audience (voters) in the\ntwo countries in order to understand the reasoning behind the appeals that emerged from the\nsample and understand why they were chosen.\nCulture is defined as the way of life, in which a group of people share common\npractices (norms) and refute others (Mukherjee, 1996). Ahead of pointing out some of the\nmajor differences in ‘political culture/s’ in the two countries, it is important to note, briefly,\nthe differences between the two countries in terms of how they were founded as to further\ncontextualize the audience more in the two cases. This was helpful in the interpretation of the\nappeals that emerged from the data by revealing the segmented audience these appeals were\ndesigned to target. For example, when an advertisement made historical references to events\nand/or historical figures to evoke a sense of nationalism. For example, as will be reviewed in\nthe results section, when Trump used footage of African-Americans when he referred to the
16
American families, bearing in mind the comments he made on the whites being murdered\nmainly by black people (Wilson, 2017).\nThe UK is a sovereign state that consists of four countries (England, Wales, Scotland,\nand Northern Ireland) that were unified through a long and complicated history (Johnson,\n2015). This ‘structure’ of the UK was founded by people that, mainly, already existed in\nthese countries. Therefore, broadly speaking, the existing culture/s in the UK is the result of\nthousands of years of its indigenous peoples’ history. In recent history, the UK is not only\nknown for the industrial revolution, but also for its colonial history where the UK colonized\ncountries from six out of seven continents including parts of what is known today as the\nUnited States (Brey, 2019). This legacy of colonialism still plays a role in how a great\nproportion of people in the West, namely in the way UK see their heritage (Wiener, 2013).\nAs Wiener (2013) explains, the notion of neocolonialism developed over the years after\nWorld War II and continues to current days in different forms, is adopted by several\nsegments of the societies in the West extending to be taught in Western universities.\nOn the other hand, what led to the founding of the US as known today are events that\ngo back to the discovery of the ‘New World’ by Christopher Columbus in the fifteenth\ncentury and the historical events that followed of colonization, slavery, independence (from\nthe British rule), Civil War, prohibiting slavery and movements of civil rights in the recent\nhistory (Jenkins, 2017). These historic events played a role in the formation of the American\ncharacter. Namely, of how the country was built on the idea of people immigrating from all\nparts of the world to start a new, prosperous life in the ‘New World’(Jenkins, 2017). The\nimmigration of people from different countries entailed the existence of different cultures that\ninteracted and generated new ‘hybrid-cultures’ or what is also known as multiculturism.\nMulticulturism refers to a perspective that acknowledges the cultural differences that exist\namong members of the society rather than assuming homogeneity of culture (Mukherjee,\n1996). Because multiculturism became a ‘norm’ in the US, which refers to the culture that is\nadopted by the majority of the people, historically, far right movements such as the Ku Klux\nKlan (KKK) who are white supremacists that believe in the superiority of the White Race\nwere formed as a counterculture. The KKK, refers to two distinct hate organizations in the\nUS that employed terror to ensure the supremacy of the White Race by attempting to\nreconstruct the racial supremacy map following the freeing of slaves that was the main reason\nbehind the Civil War (KKK Britannica). Countercultures are movements that defy the ‘norm’\nand are founded in the form of movements by people that share the same views (Costello,\n1972). The awareness about historical movements that still play a role in the cultural struggle\n17
between different groups in the society, are of high significance to how something as political\nads are crafted. To illustrate, when some ads refer to an issue of controversy between readers\n(e.g., the right to bear arms in the U.S.) that is usually adopted by readers that lean more to\nthe right-wing on the political spectrum. For example, 56% of Republicans (right-wing) see\nthat mass shooting would decrease if more people owned guns, and 64% of Democrats see\nthat these accidents would decrease if less people owned guns (Oliphant, 2017).\nIn a more rigid attempt to categorize citizens (voters) in both the U.S. and the UK,\nNorris and Inglehart (2019) assert that people, do indeed, form what they referred to as tribes.\nTribes, according to Norris and Inglehart (2019), are imaginary communities that are\n“demarcated by signifiers of us versus them […]” (p. 7). These tribes hold shared values and\ntraditions that go beyond just sharing race and religion extending to, among other shared\ntraits, the same culture and dialect. Additionaly, Norris and Inglehart (2019) theorize that the\nterm ‘tribe’ as a structure holds more to it than simply being a lose conception about a group\nof people, especially in times when these people feel individual and collective danger that\nthreatens their ‘way of life’. Building on this notion, Norris and Inglehart (2019) rationalize\nthat the politics of fear is indeed a lead tactic used by populist politicians, especially ones that\nhold authoritarian values, to gain political power in Western democracies. While this notion\nmight seem to strongly dismiss the audience’s agency in terms of not being critical about the\ninformation they consume from media, Norris and Inglehart (2019) argue that this state was a\nresult of Western democracies reaching what they called the ‘tipping point’. As part of the\nCultural back-lash theory, the ‘tipping point’ according the authors, is a point in the political\nsphere in a specific country where citizens are negatively charged against the political\nestablishment, and involves high levels of individual and collective frustration that concerns\nthe economy, future, cultural values and norms, and in sometimes the racial supremacy map.\nTherefore, they argue that populist politicians take advantage of this frustration by channeling\ntheir focus on activating and mobilizing these angry people by focusing their media\nmessages’ topics that appeal to people’s fears such as economy or income, immigration,\ncultural or religious values, etc.\nThe cultural differences between the two countries in which the two events took place\nalso entails the political culture as a general scheme that, to a large extent, guides political\npractices in a given society. The cultural differences highlighted in this part were used in the\nanalysis. In this section I focus on the main political parties and institutions that represent the\nright-wing on the UK’s political spectrum as the main driving force behind the Brexit\nreferendum including the Vote Leave campaign. In the UK, current political culture consists,\n18
like other political systems, from the right-wing, the conservatives, and the left-wing, the\nliberals (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). The right-wing including parties such as UKIP that was\none of the leading Eurosceptic parties and was highly interrelated to, and a supporter of Vote\nLeave during the Brexit event in 2016 (Walker, 2016; Morillas, 2017). This party, alongside\nwith other far-right parties, such as the National Front and British National Party did not only\nshare Euroscepticism, but also adopted, and called for the implementation of xenophobic\npolicies (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). Xenophobic politics are understood in this research as\npractices in which different races, and immigration are not accepted, attacked, and seen as a\nthreat that justifies discrimination against them (Norris and Inglehart, 2019).\nIn the US, political culture is different form the UK. The right-wing or the\nconservatives are represented by the Republican party and has different views from those of\nthe British right-wing shares, however, it is important to note that they do share some\nideological values. These differences are apparent in the constitutional rights that allow\npeople and organizations, to bear arms and form militias (“The History Of The Right To Bear\nArms”, 2020). The Second Amendment in the US Constitution that gave these rights to the\nAmerican people is one example of the debate over gun control between conservatives and\nliberals (“The History Of The Right To Bear Arms”, 2020). In his first presidential debate in\n2020, Donald Trump was asked to condemn white supremacists, in particular, the Proud\nBoys, a group categorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigations as an extremist group\n(Belam and Gabbatt, 2020), he refused and told them to “stand-back and stand-by” (Smith,\nBeckett, Singh and Wong, 2020).\nSome scholars state that Trump extends from just being a candidate in a presidential\nelection to be a movement on its own right (Lieberman, Mattler, Pepinsky, Roberts and\nValelly, 2017). While others that studied American presidents discourse claim that Trump is\nnot an outlier in the American political history (Jordan, Sterling, Pennenbaker and Boyd,\n2018). The significance that Trump brought to the US political culture is built on the\nhistorical movements in the U.S. For example, Trump hat that reads “Make America Great\nAgain” forming the acronym MAGA. This hat did not only represent Trump as a candidate\nbut also signifies the movement that is referred to as Trumpism (“Understanding Trump and\nTrumpism”, 2020). Moreover, the hat was described by the black fashion critic Robin Givhan\nas becoming “[…] a symbol of us vs. them, of exclusion and suspension, of garrulous\nnarcissism, of white male privilege, of violence and hate […]” (as quoted in Tong, 2019).\nAdditionally, the hat was described by the African American rapper Pusha T as “this\ngeneration’s Ku Klux hood” (as quoted in Tong, 2019).\n19
From part one it can be concluded that, while both campaigns held similar ideological\nstances on specific topics (immigration, own country’s position on a global scale, and its\nrelationship with bigger bodies, both campaigns have their historical, political, culture and\nevent (referendum vs. elections) specifics that should be accounted for in the interpretation.\n2.2
Part two
In this part I review the traditional populist communication model, then, I link it to social\nmedia campaigning and online disinformation.\n2.2.1 Political communication\nPolitical communication, regardless of its source and/or level, is not only designed to\nconvey information to constituents, but is also “strategic, intentional and purposive” (p. 391)\nin nature, and, in principle, is designed to build loyalty (Jacobs, 2017). Furthermore, in\nmodern purposeful political communication, such as in campaigning, there are two main\nsignificant developments, first, political communication, as a process, has become highly\nsophisticated, and second, due to these constant developments, institutional communication\ndeveloped a more complex (constantly changing) and effective model of political\ncommunication (Jacobs, 2017). This is quite evident in the employment of new\ncommunication technologies such as social media in political communication. The Vote\nLeave Campaign for example, made use of the social media networks as platforms to spread\ntheir political messages (advertisements) but also made use of algorithms that identified\nvoters that might be susceptible to their messages (Cadwalladr, 2017).\nAdditionally, Jacobs (2017) observed that “Institutional-based communications have,\nunder certain circumstances, more enduring and deeper effects, than the personalistic and\noften time-delimited aspects of situational framing” (p. 392). In other words, it is thought that\ninstitutional-based political communication can be more effective towards constituents than\nmessages that are coming from a less organizational discourse even if it is from a political\nleader that is functioning in a less informal and less organizational environment. The\norganization that took place during the Brexit event by the Vote Leave Campaign in terms of\nadopting a uniform rhetoric is one example, considering that Vote Leave was working\nalongside and deeply connected to other Eurosceptic organizations. Similarly, the Trump\nCampaign was not only an organization that used its own institutional-communication with\nvoters, but also was connected to other organizations that supported Trump, adopted the same\nrhetoric and worked on spreading it on different media platforms. For example, The Heritage\nFoundation, and The Moral Majority. Takens and van Hoof (2011) argue, on the other hand,\n20
that populist politicians make use of political personalization to make the focus of the\ncampaign on the leader as one of the strategies of convincing voters. Also, narrowing the\nissues agenda during a political campaign makes it easier for the voter to follow the\ncampaign’s line of reasoning (Takens & van Hoof, 2011). The research question of this thesis\naimed at examining the notion of political personalization, and how the issues agenda is\nconstructed as two distinct persuasion techniques.\nPolitical communication has the capacity, under certain circumstances, to affect voter\nbehavior. In other words, make voters, at least on an individual level, change their minds and\neven change sides during elections. When politicians decide on adopting old or new topics\n(issues) in relation to a party’s political stance (e.g., abortion), Tesler and Zaller (2017)\nsuggest that this adoption of specific topics play a significant role in how a voter reacts to it\nin terms of voting decisions. To illustrate, they observed that the voter can either change their\nmind about a topic they had preexisting opinions on, and therefore, align with their original\npolitical party, or on the other hand, change sides to vote for the opponent political party. The\nfirst case underlines the importance of political communication in its institutional form, the\nlatter, suggests that voters can be critical about information they receive from mass media\n(Tesler and Zaller, 2017). For the issues-agenda for the two studied campaigns, they adopted,\nto a large extent, similar issues that they placed their focus on communicating with voters\n(Norris and Inglehart, 2019).\nOn the importance of the issues agenda topics, Carsey and Layman (2006) theorize\nthat if the topic is of significance to the voter (e.g., aligns or contradicts with strong religious\nviews) and their political party’s view on it is different, the voter is likely to switch to another\nparty that aligns to their views, on the other hand, if the topic is of less importance to the\nvoter, they tend to change their views on it to adopt their original party’s position (Tesler &\nZaller, 2017). In other words, party-sponsored communication can indeed, to various\ndegrees, affect voter behavior (Tesler & Zaller, 2017), and although some of these messages\nover time “tend to cancel out” (p.79), in some cases, they have the capacity to “swing the\noutcomes of national elections” (p.79). Moreover, in times where there is a political conflict,\ndata suggests that people who reside with journalist-sponsored messages as opposed to partysponsored communication tend to be the small minority (Tesler & Zaller, 2017).\n2.2.2 Political messages and partisanship\nJarvis (2017) pointed out some of the important roles that the political parties play in\na modern democracy such as: “gain elected office, control governing processes, mobilize
21
majorities, structure dissent and opposition, recruit future political leaders, socialize voters,\nand serve as a connection between campaigns and governance” (p. 133). Consequently, Jarvis\n(2017) illustrates how parties adopt what he called rhetorical functions; moreover, partisan\nmessages that are conveyed either by party organizations and/or their nominees have the\ncapacity to “reveal priorities, highlight objectives, imply political strategies and offer images\nof the desired brands” (p. 134). As Jarvis (2017) pointed out, this is mainly done be the\nparty’s elites and relying on what he called party labels. Party labels are widely used in the\npolitical communication process and serves as main cues that influence voting behavior\n(Jarvis, 2017). Furthermore, these party labels, according to Jarvis (2017) “provide simple,\ndirect, and consequential information in shaping individual perceptions” (p. 136). According\nto Herrera (1997), labels are understood by citizens (voters) on different levels of political\nsophistication and regardless of their level of political participation, also, Herrera (1997)\nargues that there is a “quite remarkable linkage between the mass public and the political elite\nwith regard to political terminology” (As cited in Jarvis, 2017, p. 137). While these labels are\ntaken for granted features in the political communication process, they play a vital role, and\nof paramount importance to those who use it. Labeling allows political parties to have their\nown vocabulary that distinguishes them form other parties and can ultimately lead to\naffecting, proportionately, voting behavior (Jarvis, 2017). These labels were used by both\ncampaigns as an attack method to discredit their opponents (Norris and Inglehart, 2019).\n2.2.3 Political advertisements\nPolitical communication studies distinguish political advertisements into three main\ncategories: advocacy, that is, ads that focus on why voters should vote for a nominee (ad\nsponsor) by showing the voters what is perceived to possess positive and desirable features in\nthe society (Lilleker, 2006), what distinguishes what is positive or negative is called doxa,\nthat is, the shared knowledge in a society (Van Belle, Gillaerts, Van Gorp, Van De Mieroop,\n& Rutten, 2013); and second, negative, that is, ads that focus on opponents rather than the\nmessage sponsor (candidate) to show voters why it is ‘not the right thing to do’ (Lilleker,\n2006), this type of ads is also called attack ads for the attack element it inherently features\n(Belt, 2017), while others categorize attack ads to be different type of ads on its own account\n(Dolan in Schultz, 2004) in this thesis negative ads refers to attack advertisements; and\nfinally, contrast ads, that is, advertisements that focus on the positive side of the candidate\n(sponsor) and the negative side of the opponent (Lilleker, 2006).
22
It is quite common that the candidates with lower chances of winning are the ones that\nstart using negative ads as an attempt to increase their chances (Belt, 2017). Additionally,\nbecause of the negative information that these ads contain, targeted candidates are required to\nanswer to the information these ads provide, thus, forces them to be in a defensive mode as\nprocrastination may be devastating (Belt, 2017). In this thesis, special attention was given to\nnegative ads in the analysis process, looking for different techniques used in crafting negative\nads as explained by Belt (2017). First, as Belt (2017) explains, attack ads are strategically\nused by candidates to aggravate fear, and to raise doubts about the opponent to create public\nanxiety. Second, special techniques are used in attack ads to make it more appealing to the\ntargeted audience, for example, the use of black-and-white photos to portray candidates under\nattack while bright colors are used to portray candidates in positive ads (West, 2014 as cited\nin Belt, 2017). This change of color that may seem of minor importance is a common\ntechnique used by experts crafting political advertisements (Belt, 2017) to signify how they\nportray the candidate or the subject of the advertisement. Also, the use gray imagery and\ndarker skin tones are used to increase anxiety and reinforce negative stereotypes (Belt, 2017).\nAccording to Fallis (2017), audience are active, and the general assumption is that\npolitical advertisements work in the same way as all other sorts of political communication,\nthat is, they reinforce preexisting ideas rather than totally changing them. However, Fallis\n(2017) argues that political ads, on an individual level, can affect voting behavior.\nFurthermore, Fallis (2017) points to some of the functions and features of political ads in an\nattempt to illustrate how political ads can affect the voting behavior:\nVoter-learning\nOn the one hand, political ads can expand a voter’s knowledge on a specific topic or\nabout a specific candidate due to its informative nature, on the other, it can lead to the spread\nof inaccurate information i.e., disinformation (Fallis, 2017).\nEmotional appeals\nDifferent studies found evidence that the most successful political ads are those\ncharacterized by making use of strong emotional appeals and, in some cases, even have the\ncapacity to change voter behavior (Belt, 2017; Fallis, 2017).\nAgenda-setting\nScholars have found that political ads do not only have the capacity to make voters\nthink about specific topics, but in some cases, political ads have the capacity to channel how\npeople think about these topic, a process known as second-level agenda-setting (Belt, 2017;\nFallis, 2017) or framing (see Entman, 1993).\n23
Finally, Fallis (2017) also stated that some personal traits in combination with\npolitical ads can easily cause a change in voter’s behavior such as negativity bias. For\nexample, people tend to weigh negative experiences more than positive ones. Similarly,\nnegative information has more impact on people (voters) than positive news (Fallis, 2017).\nThis has led that the general assumption about how people will react to political ads is that\npeople are expected to recall the negative news or information about a candidate more than\nthey can recall positive ones, especially, while making decisions (Fallis, 2017). Another type\nof traits that might play a significantly role is confirmation bias. In this type of biases, people\ntend to pick the information they consume in political ads that serves best their point of view\nwhile discarding or dismissing any other opposing information, even if true (Fallis, 2017).
2.2.4 Populism and the populist rhetoric\nWhile there is no unified definition for populism, drawing on their own, among other\nscholars’ work, Block and Negrine (2017) define populism as “an appeal to people […];\nantielitist, antiestablishment ideologies, sentiments, and tactics […]; a discourse\ncharacterized by belligerent ethos and plain language that provide a sense of closeness\nbetween leaders and their politically disenchanted public […]” (p. 179). Others such as\nLilleker (2006) defined it through the elements by which populism as a communication\nprocess functions. To illustrate, Lilleker (2006) characterized populism communication as\nnaturally propagandist and rhetorical and can make substantial use of emotionalism and\nauthenticity.\nLilleker (2006) defined propaganda as the “communication that is deliberately\ndesigned by one group in society to influence the attitudes and behavior of the others. It often\nuses symbolism and rhetoric and appeals to the emotional and irrational aspects of our\nsensibility” (p. 162), and “has highly negative associations” (p. 163). According to Lilleker\n(2006), propaganda generally abides by specific rules, propaganda is designed to draw\nreaders to focus on topics that is not only implied in the text, but also to topics that are\nbeyond the text. This according to the author may cause conflicts between readers over these\ntopics (issues) by making them compare between positive and negative scenarios that are\nrelated to these topics discussed. For example, issues such as immigration and how readers\nwould take the stance with or against it, causing societal conflicts.\nAdditionally, populist politicians such as Johnson and Trump, while addressing the\nmasses, they start by ‘setting up the stage’ for the audience by making claims about how
24
corrupt the ‘system’ is (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). Then, they tend to focus on what is\nknown as the first-order principles, that is, claims concerning who should lead, and\nintentionally neglect to address second-order principles, that is, a clear plan about what\nshould be done in order to ‘fix the system’ (Norris and Inglehart, 2019).\nThe use of rhetoric in propaganda entails the use of language and symbolism to make\nsure that the information encoded in propaganda communication is decoded in the intended\nway. This means that while the main function of any rhetoric is to persuade the readers, it\nalso encourages them to change their behavior in ways that are desired by those who have\ncreated it (Lilleker, 2006). Furthermore, in order for a rhetoric to be successful and resonate\nwith readers, the rhetoric must be designed through crucial understanding of the audience\ncomplexities, address their fears, and appeal to their norms and values (Lilleker, 2006),\nthrough what was referred to earlier as doxa. Furthermore, populist rhetoric in political\ndiscourse is a communication style that, on the most basic level, is an ideological stance\nagainst the existing political establishment and, is a sort of instrumentalization of\ncommunication as a means to gain political power (Takens & van Hoof, 2011). Likewise,\nmany scholars coincide in the notion that the elements of the populist rhetoric make “positive\nreference to “the people”, and criticism of the political elite” (Jager & Walgrave, 2006 in\nTakens & van Hoof, 2011, p. 332).\nEmotionalization refers to the use of emotions in political communication to win the\nsupport of the voters; some scholars argue that emotionalization is done by politicians as a\nresponse to public demand of seeing the electoral process as an emotional experience\n(Lilleker, 2006). Likewise, studies in sociology support the notion that emotions is a more\npowerful force in making voting decisions; studies in political communication, however,\nshow otherwise, and that the voter are rational and can make an informed decision based on\nlogic while weighing who can lead the country with the emotional aspect being a secondary\nelement (Lilleker, 2006).\nEmotionalization is intrinsically a part of authenticity, that is, a trait by which a\npolitician aims at appearing as ‘real’ and someone that is close to the voters, in order to make\nit easier for them to identify with the politician (Lilleker, 2006). This is done by building an\nauthentic image, and this can be achieved by the politician sharing their emotional side or\nexperience with the audience (Lilleker, 2006).
25
2.2.5 Political persuasion techniques\nWhen Aristotle wrote his book The Art of Rhetoric (in other translations titled\nTreatise on Rhetoric or Rhetoric), he categorized oration into three main types based on\nintentions (uses) and also the tenses that normally follow in the language structure used by\nthe orator. The first type of speech according to Yunis (2018) was branded by Aristotle as\nforensic (also known as judicial rhetoric), this type of rhetoric is usually in the past tense and\nis used usually to attack or defend someone in relation to legal settings; the second type is\ncalled epideictic (also translated to ceremonial speech) which is a demonstrative rhetoric, and\nis usually used to describe something in the present tense such as in speeches during wedding\nceremonies; and finally, deliberative rhetoric (in some translations symbouleutikon or\npolitical), that is, the type of rhetoric that is used seeking to persuade people to do something\nand/or change a current state, and is usually used in the future tense (e.g., to convince citizens\nto vote for a specific candidate in an upcoming elections). Furthermore, Yunis (2018)\nexplains how Aristotle rationalizes that in deliberative rhetoric, orators can use three different\nappeals that will help them persuade their audience to act in a certain way. The first appeal\nAristotle defined is ethos. This appeal entails the establishment of trust between the audience\nand the speaker through convincing the audience that the speaker is credible, at least on the\ntopic being discussed. The second appeal is logos, that is, reasoning through the use of\nlanguage, sometimes referred to as the logical appeal. While logic and reasoning may seem\nas ‘the same thing’, reasoning is more complicated as correct and false logic may be\nappealing to the audience. And finally, pathos, that is, the appeals to emotions that are made\nby the orator to stimulate or trigger specific emotions that might help the orator achieve a\nspecific goal. These goals, as will be reviewed shortly, may be visible or invisible to the\naudience.\nAdditionally, Takens and Van Hoof (2011) theorize that it is not only the quality of\nrhetoric that determines the persuasion effects of the political messages, but also the topics\n(issues) being discussed play a significant role in the persuasion process. For example, both\ncampaigns (Trump 2016 and Vote Leave) used “slander, lying and verbal abuse to make their\ncase” (Schmidt, 2017, p. 260). Strategies such as lying was not the only strategy employed by\nthe two campaigns to persuade voters but also strategies such as throwing consequential\naccusations on opponents to put them in a defensive position (Schmidt, 2017). Other\nstrategies are used to persuade readers such as the use of negative (attack) ads. Negative ads\nhave the capacity to simulate voters to seek information to prove the accuser either correct or
26
incorrect about their accusations (Borah, 2016). This tactic does not only employ voterlearning as a rhetorical function but also employs agenda-setting as explained by Fallis\n(2017). This last function (agenda-setting) is one of the main tactics used by both campaigns\nin 2016 (Norris and Inglehart, 2019).
2.2.6 Political communication in the age of new media\nDuring the two studied events, both campaigns made use of new-media technologies\nto reach-out more effectively to voters (Cadwalladr, 2017; Cadwalladr & Glendinning, 2018),\nespecially the younger generations. In the Vote Leave Campaign case, they had created a\nsub-campaign called BeLeave that was designed to target younger liberal progressive voters\n(The Guardian, Jun 27, 2018). The communication with voters through social media differs\nfrom traditional media in both the approach and the outcomes. This is quite evident in three\nkey differences according to Frankel and Hillygus (2017): the first is that social media allows\nan almost direct interaction channel between the message creator (campaign) and the voter;\nthe second, the interaction between the campaign and voter is not in a one-way direction as in\nthe traditional media case, or at least, it provides each potential voter on social media the\nmeans to directly communicate with the campaign of interest and other voters as well,\nmaking it a two-way (if not more) communication process; and finally, many of these social\nmedia platforms are monolithic in nature (e.g., email, WhatsApp), meaning that it requires\ndifferent logics in the way messages are designed and presented to the voters.\nAs illustrated, social media use in campaigning and political communication requires\ndifferent logics than traditional media sources (e.g., TV, radio and print), at least in some\nrespects. For example, social media allowed for microtargeting on a mass scale and based on\nclearly defined characteristics (Frankel & Hillygus, 2017), which was something not known\nin political campaigning even in the early stages of the Internet. Further, Owen (2017) argues\nthat the utilization of new media (social media) has not only led to the creation of a\nmultilayered communication environment between the campaigners and the voters, but also\nthat new media has led to a change in how information it disseminated to the masses. For\nexample, Owen (2017) explains that traditional media such as TV, radio and print were\nadopting a broadcasting approach, that is, to treat the masses as a one body, however, after\nnew media was used in campaigning and in political communication, message creators began\nto adopt the narrowcasting approach “where carefully crafted messages target discrete\naudience segments” (p. 832), this was due to what social media platforms as a digital form of
27
technology provided to collect data about the users, which in turn, helped concerned parties\nto better understand the audience on an individual level, thus, categorizing citizens to be\nbetter targeted with political ads.\n2.2.7 Online political- campaigning, advertising, and disinformation\nAs aforementioned, the design of social media platforms and how people use them\nresults in continuous growth user-data, leading to understanding users on an individualized\nlevel, leading to creating personalized ads such as the dark ads (Cadawalladr, 2017 as cited in\nAlaphilippe et al., 2019). Facebook for example, designed the Lookalike audience tool\n("Learn about Lookalike Audiences | Facebook Business Help Centre", 2020)\nthat allows the targeting of the audience to be conducted based on the predefined\ncharacteristics and/or demographics that are much more complicated than previous Facebook\ntargeting methods (Alaphilippe et al., 2019). The lookalike audience tool is a service\nprovided by Facebook for customers that want to reach a certain audience based on\npredefined trends and is restricted to one country per campaign ("Learn about Lookalike\nAudiences | Facebook Business Help Centre", 2020). To maximize results from this tool,\nFacebook asks advertisers to provide them with audience examples ranging between 100 and\n50000 Facebook accounts ("Learn about Lookalike Audiences | Facebook Business Help\nCentre", 2020). By analyzing these examples provided by the customers, Facebook is better\nable to target new ‘similar’ Facebook users with advertisements on its platform ("Learn about\nLookalike Audiences | Facebook Business Help Centre", 2020).\nDue to the highly personalized nature of the dark ads, this type of ads had different\ntargeting strategies to be more effective. These dark ads did not only appear to the social\nmedia users that fall in the targeted audience segment, but also allowed comprehensive\ndigital feedback for message optimization by analyzing the data generated from how the\naudience interacted with these ads (Alaphilippe et al., 2019). In order to maximize the\naudience engagement on Facebook advertisements, the Trump 2016 Campaign, for example,\nmade use of 5.9 million ads “to identify and then promote those variants that generated most\nFacebook engagement” (Alaphilippe et al., 2019, p. 18). Finally, these dark ads\ncharacteristics have “helped advertisers [campaigners] from cultivating a certain image\nthrough their organic posts, while at the same time they can promote their hidden messages\n[…]” (Alaphilippe et al. 2019, p. 18).\nRecently, many scholars have called for the adoption of the terms mis-information,\ndis-information and mal-information, instead of the “ill-defined” (p. 7) term of ‘fake news’
28
(Alaphilippe, 2019). Misinformation refers to factual information (news) that is shared\nunintentionally, without meaning to cause harm; disinformation, on the other hand, refers to\nnonfactual information (news) that is deliberately shared to cause harm and/or personal\nbenefit; and finally, malinformation, which refers to factual information (genuine) that was\nintended to remain private or collected without consent and shared to cause harm\n(Alaphilippe et al., 2019). For example, pornographic footage that was meant to remain\nprivate, hate speech recorded with or without the knowledge of the speaker, or what was\nconsidered ‘normal’ back in time but now is considered racist such as images or video\nfootage of politicians in Western countries wearing ‘black face’ during their teenage. While\ndistinguishing between the three main types of information disorder might seem obvious, in\nreal life however, distinguishing between them can be of high sophistication as they have a\nnatural tendency to overlap, especially in political campaigns (Alaphilippe et al., 2019).\nTherefore, this research adopted the term disinformation instead of fake news defined by the\nEuropean Parliament’s High Level Expert Group (HLEG) that defined disinformation as\nfollows: “all forms of false, inaccurate, or misleading information designed, presented, and\npromoted to intentionally cause public harm or profit” (Buning et al. 2018 as cited in\nAlaphilippe et al. 2019, p. 6).\nOnline disinformation in the form of false news can be challenging to readers to\nnaturally identify, making the readers susceptible, one way or another, to it (Zhou and\nZafarani, 2018). This is not only for how much disinformation campaigns can spread, but\nalso because of how the content creators utilize “propaganda techniques around linguistic,\ncultural, and national differences, to create new social barriers and divisions, as well as\ncausing financial and personal damages” (Alaphilippe et al., 2019, p. 7). Some studies that\nlooked for persuasion techniques in disinformation campaigns that were used to enhance their\nmessage credibility and were able to identify the main techniques that were implemented in\nthose disinformation campaigns (Alaphilippe et al. 2019). These techniques are: ad hominem,\nthat is, to attack the opponent in a personalized and negative manner instead of attacking the\nargument; ad nauseam, that is, to constantly repeat a phrase or a slogan so that citizens would\nadopt it and repeat it in their discourse (e.g., Trump’s “chain migration” idea about how\npeople migrate to the US and start to bring in their relatives); cherry picking, that is, to decide\nto pick specific facts to be presented in an argument while deliberately avoiding other facts to\nchange or distort people’s perceptions of a topic (similar to confirmation bias); appealing to\nstrong emotions such as “fear, anger, or prejudice” (p.8); deception, that is, to mislead the
29
readers through false presentation of events; and finally, humor, that is used in a negative\nway against opponents to ridicule them and/or their policies (Alaphilippe et al., 2019).\nFrom part two it can be concluded that populist rhetorical functions are used by\npopulist politicians in their political campaigning advertisements that contain disinformation.\nThese rhetorical functions play a major role in the persuasion process of the reader to\nconvince them to vote for the campaign. The difference between these online ads and the\ntraditional advertisement forms, however, remain in the interactions that occur online\nbetween the readers and others. This is due to the role that social media plays in amplifying\nthese sensational media messages.

3.1
Methodology and research design
Methodological approach and units of analysis\nThe research of this project focused, mainly, on the persuasive techniques in the ads
of the two campaigns in the UK and the US in 2016. In order to answer the research question,\nqualitative methods in the form of rhetorical analysis was chosen. Brennen (2017)\ndistinguishes between qualitative and quantitative methods as the former is “interdisciplinary,\ninterpretive, political and theoretical in nature” (p.4). Moreover, one of the features of\nqualitative methods is that it provides the tools needed to make sense of the constructed\nreality of a given society (Brennen, 2017), also referred to in the theoretical framework as\ndoxa (Van Belle et al., 2013). Assuming the viewpoint that realities are socially constructed\n(Brennen, 2017), the language used for communication is likely to mirror these realities\nbecause of how language is expected to resonate with the audience targeted by it.\nAccordingly, this understanding can be achieved by the analysis of words, texts, speeches,\nslang and so forth. In other words, the analysis of the communication texts in a given society\nor phenomenon may, indeed, reveal information that will allow better understanding of this\nsociety or phenomenon. And therefore, the analysis of the language used in the analyzed ads,\nas identified earlier by Hall (2013) helped in identifying, first, the persuasion techniques by\nboth campaigns, and second, the commonalities and differences among them.\nDue to the focus of this thesis, to identify any existing common patterns in populist\npersuasion techniques in both the UK and the US in 2016 (Vote Leave and the Trump 2016\npresidential campaigns), rhetorical analysis was chosen as the chief analysis method. Brennen\n(2017) describes rhetorical analysis as “particularly appropriate when one is assessing aspects\nof advertising and public relations, and when persuasion is an integral part of the media text”\n(p. 216) which justifies the use of this method to conduct this research. For the four cases\nmentioned by Brennen (2017), advertising, public relations, persuasion, and media texts, they\nall perfectly apply to the texts analyzed in this research. Starting from the latter, media texts,\nall the sample units are media texts, either Facebook post ads, or TV ads. For the\nadvertisements and persuasion aspects of the texts, all sample units are political campaign\nadvertisements, and the research question was answered by looking for persuasion techniques\nin these ads, thus, meeting the conditions mentioned by Brennen (2017). Therefore, rhetorical\nanalysis was considered the best analysis method that would answer the research question.\n31
In doing rhetorical analysis, it is essential to take the “relationship between the text,\nits author or producer, the intended audience and the relevant context for the production and\nthe reception of the text” (p.216) into account (Brennen, 2017). Further, Zachary (2009)\nexplains that in doing rhetorical analysis, it is quite important to understand the context\nsurrounding the text to be able to identify the Aristotelian proofs (logos, pathos, and ethos),\nand therefore, be able to infer how people would have reacted to it. This is, for example,\nachieved, under the assumption that rhetoricians - people who wrote texts or speeches mainly\nfor the purpose of persuasion- were well aware not only of the sought events, but also,\nunderstood their audience and knew what they want to hear. Accordingly, a researcher doing\nrhetorical analysis must be able to identify key aspects and events that may affect the waning\nof a text. In other words, background knowledge of the context surrounding each campaign is\nimportant to have a deeper understanding of the real intention behind the text. Therefore, I\nrelied on journalistic sources that would explain if something referred to in the ads was not\nclear. For example, ads usually do not contain the full story, such as when Trump accuses\nClinton with allegations.\nZachary (2009) identifies three main approaches to rhetorical analysis. The first one,\nis the basic or traditional form of analysis, which goes back to the work of individuals such\nas Aristotle and Cicero until the beginning of the twentieth century. The second approach is\ncalled the new rhetoric, this approach has emerged due to the complications resulting from\nthe more extensive use of symbolism that created the need for more sophisticated analysis\ntools. This new type of analysis was referred to by Burke (as cited in Zachary, 2009) as\ndramatism. That is, an analytical approach that “requires to view human actions as theatrical,\ndiscernible in a pentad of interrelated elements: act, scene, agent, agency, agency and\npurpose” (p. 74). As explained by Zachary (2009), this approach developed by Burke, has\nprovided the tools to analyze texts and speeches to understand the deeply rooted ideological\nbeliefs of the audience. This was, according to Burke (as cited in Zachary, 2009), because of\nhow people engaged in a specific rhetoric, since people, metaphorically, filter topics based on\nwhat he called terministic screens. This was based on the belief that “language does not\ncorrespond to reality, but instead, filters and selects” (p.74). Finally, and most importantly,\nthe critical-postmodern approach. This approach is the one used in the analysis of this study\nfor three reasons. Frist, it acknowledges the role that the audience play in creation of a media\nmessage (advertisements). Second, it focuses on topics (issues) that are salient or absent in\nthe text. and finally, this approach provides a more critical account of how audience may\ninteract to a given text.\n32
This approach is the most complicated because it starts from the notion that rhetoric\ncodifies and “perpetuates what counts as real or the truth in society” (Zachary, 2009, p. 75).\nIn other words, the analyst must be able to identify how the different groups in a society may\ninterpret specific events. For example, how a Republican African American vs. a Democrat\nAfrican American would likely interpret a speech from a Republican or a Democrat politician\non an ideological and provocative topic such as abortion or racism. Therefore, a rhetorical\nanalyst must also, in this approach, identify how groups of interest in the audience may react\nto the speech or text. Moreover, as explained by Brennen (2017), background knowledge\nabout the context of the text and the audience is vital to maximize the probability of fully\nunderstanding the text and the intentions behind it, and thus, inferring how it might resonate\nwith different segments in the audience. Furthermore, scholars that adopt this theoretical\napproach see human knowledge as probable, in terms of how people are persuaded about\nspecific topics and do not assume homogeneity among all studied society members (Zachary,\n2009). Also, the theoretical approach of critical postmodernism “marks a radically different\nway of thinking about truth and reality from those ideas that had dominated scholarly inquiry\nthroughout much of recorded history” (Zachary, 2009, p.75).\nThe rhetorical analysis in this study was done looking not only for the rhetorical\nappeals in the text, but by adding multiple dimensions that served the purpose of answering\nthe research question. For example, in the UK dataset, the Vote Leave Campaign relied on\nother companies (Cambridge Analytica and its daughter company Aggregate IQ ) to design\nadvertisements that, allegedly, be assumed to appeal to voters on an individual level, where in\nthe US case, the corresponding ads were Facebook post that were shared with all Facebook\nmembers of the Trump official Facebook group. In this example, in the UK Vote Leave ads\nrelied on a more complex method not only in the designing phase, but also the distribution of\nwhom these ads will appear to, and hence, analysis of these advertainments provided a more\nprecise account of the types of voters the Vote Leave Campaign was appealing to. In the\nUS’s corresponding advertisements, because these ads were shared on a collective level, the\nanalysis of it ushered to the issues that were focused on during the Trump 2016 presidential\ncampaign. This difference in the approach to persuade voters in the two cases had varying\neffects on how the advertisements in both cases were designed and will be illustrated in the\nresults section.\nThroughout strategic and persuasive uses of rhetorical strategies, scholars that use the\ncritical- postmodern approach in rhetorical analysis acknowledge that specific topics can be\nmore prominent than its opposite. Therefore, concepts such as power are seen as inherent in\n33
some societies more than other, and thus, is present in their use of language (Zachary, 2009).\nAdditionally, Zachary (2009) sees that any component of the human communication is open\nfor rhetorical analysis as some latent meaning is made using different than the traditional\ncommunication objects. For example, (facial) gestures and new communication technologies\nthat depend of signifiers (e.g., emojis) that readers make meaning form as described earlier\nby Hall (2013).\n3.2
Sampling\nThe unit of analysis that composed the sample analyzed in this thesis, consisted of TV
and Facebook advertisements/posts that were used by the Vote Leave Campaign and the\nTrump Campaign in the UK and the U.S. in 2016, respectively. The sampling method that\nwas used to gather the sample was the purposive sampling as described by Babbie (2015). In\npurposive sampling, the researcher may make judgements about the sample for how it is\nrelevant to answer the research question of the study, and may ignore irrelevant sample units\n(Babbie, 2015). Besides making judgements about what to include in the sample, this\nsampling method was used for other reasons. First, because the ads (group one and two) were\nin two different events and are not identical in the way they were distributed, a uniform\nsampling approach, in this case, would have not been useful. For example, the Vote Leave\ndark ads were not visible to all Facebook users (e.g., in a specific Facebook group) and the\ncontent of these ads was not publicly known until Facebook revealed them to the British\nParliament after the Cambridge Analytica scandal (Cadwalladr & Glendinning, 2018; Lomas,\n2018). The corresponding ads from the Trump Campaign (in the form of Facebook posts), on\nthe other hand, were visible to every user that was a member of the Trump official Facebook\npage. In the case, for example, if certain criteria were pre-set, such as the number of likes on\nan ad, while this would have been possible in the Trump case, it would have been impossible\nin the Vote Leave case. Second, data was not provided in terms of how Facebook users\ninteracted with the Vote Leave advertisements. For the TV advertisements however, data was\nprovided in both cases and the selection was based on the availability on the official Vote\nLeave YouTube channel (only ten ads were found and were used in the sample for group\nthree), and the number of times the TV ads were aired in the Trump case (group four). In the\nTrump case, the ads found on a website (https://politicaladarchive.org) which provided useful\ninformation about every advertisement it included. For example, the number of times the ad\nwas aired, where, number of networks that aired the ad, sponsor, an estimate of the number of\nviews, and most importantly, fact checks on the information it contained. Therefore, the
34
advertisements chosen in group-four to represent the Trump 2016 TV advertisements were\nbased on, in the same order, sponsor (had to be a Trump 2016 Campaign ad), the highest\nnumber of ads aired, and whenever present, ads that were fact-checked and contained\ndisinformation. More detailed information is provided for every group as follows.\n3.2.1 Group-one\nThe UK was group-one for Facebook advertisements known as the dark ads. These\nadvertisements were handed by Facebook to the British Parliament after the allegations that\nfollowed the Facebook/ Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 (Lomas, 2018).\nThe ads in this group were selected from both the Vote Leave Campaign, and the\nBeLeave Campaign. The BeLeave Campaign was a sub-campaign run by the same people\nthat were responsible for the Vote Leave Campaign (The Guardian, Jun 27, 2018). Due to the\nVote Leave targeted older generations, and BeLeave targeting younger generations (The\nGuardian, Jun 27, 2018), ads from both campaigns were included in the sample of group-one.\nUltimately, group one for UK’s Facebook dark ads was represented by fifteen ads from the\nVote Leave file, as the main campaign representing the UK populists, and ten ads to represent\nthe BeLeave campaign, that was also designed by the same company, Aggregate IQ (House\nof Commons, 2018), a Canadian firm, closely tied to Cambridge Analytica and CLS Group.\nThis has allowed to have a wider view on the rhetorical appeals and techniques that were\nused in both, interrelated, campaigns. The advertisements were in one file sent from\nFacebook to the British Parliament. An enclosed letter From the Facebook’s UK Head of\nPublic Policy, Rebecca Stimson, indicated that these were the ads ran by the Vote Leave and\nthe BeLeave Campaigns before the event of Brexit (House of Commons, 2018). The letter\nalso mentioned that Facebook groups of Vote Leave, BeLeave and other related campaigns\nwere designed and run by Aggregate IQ.\nThe ads that represented the Vote Leave Campaign were 15 in total and were chosen\npurposively from the file. I divided the ads according to the issues agenda they discuss\n(economy and trade, immigration, NHS, sovereignty, etc.) and chose the ads randomly form\nthese groups. I avoided repetition of the ads based on the topic, and the only exception was in\nthe ads that mentioned different countries that fell in the immigration ads group. This was\ndue to the connotations that would follow each country name (e.g., Turkey, a country with a\nMuslim majority and a high population).\nSimilarly, 10 advertisements were chosen from the BeLeave advertisements file sent\nfrom Facebook to the British Parliament. Complying with the methodological guidelines, the
35
number of advertisements in group-one was set to be 25 advertisements in total. Therefore, I\ndecided to make the Vote Leave Campaign ads more than the BeLeave ads for three reasons.\nFirst, the Vote Leave Campaign was the main Brexit campaign and, the BeLeave Campaign\nis one of its creations. Second, the ads provided by Facebook to the British Parliament for the\nVote Leave Campaign were more than 200 ads, while the BeLeave ads were less than 30.\nThus, providing a strong incentive to make the Vote Leave more represented. Finally, and\nmost importantly, the Vote Leave Campaign was the main focus of this research, and the\nBeLeave Campaign was of less importance in terms of the size and was used just to notice if\nthere was any difference in terms of how both campaigns communicated with their targeted\naudience.\n3.2.2 Group-two\nDespite the allegations that the Trump 2016 campaign hired Cambridge Analytica for\nthe same purpose as Vote Leave did -to target voters using dark ads on Facebook\n(Cadwalladr, 2017), a similar file provided by Facebook to an official body, at the time this\nresearch was conducted, could not be found. Therefore, the group two ads were sampled form\nthe Facebook posts that were presented on the official Trump Facebook page. The difference\nbetween the two types of ads in group one and two were different in two main aspects. The\nfirst is that the group-two ads were, in theory, visible to everyone on the Donald Trump\nFacebook page, and therefore, did not appear for other Facebook users unless shared by one\nof the Facebook group members with their friends. Also, the dark ads relied on the Facebook\nadvertising algorithm, the Lookalike audience tool, that helped reach specific people. And\nwhile the assumption is that the group-one dark ads were designed to target specific people\non Facebook, in terms of having a specific appeal to them, this difference between the two\ntypes of ads were assumed not to have a major difference in their creation and the only\ndifference assumed was the effectiveness of the Facebook algorithm. Therefore, the Trump\nFacebook group posters were chosen to represent the Trump campaign in 2016, especially,\nthat this research was focusing on the populist rhetoric in relation to disinformation, and was\naiming at comparing the content of the two campaigns’ advertisements, and the Trump\nFacebook ones were the best available at the time this research was done to represent it.\nSimilar to the sampling in group-one, the corresponding group-two was sampled\nusing purposive sampling. It is important to note here that I had a different strategy to sample\nthis group at the beginning of this project. After failing to find officially investigated ads, I\ntried to find paid ads on the Facebook ad library
36
(https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads\n&country=NL), which is supposed to contain information on political paid advertisements to\nhelp independent researchers. This attempt failed because the search options were not userfriendly and were over complicated. This did not allow me to find the advertisements I was\nlooking for automatically and had to manually go back page-by-page. Additionally, searching\nfor ads based on keywords and timeframes was not possible. Therefore, I drew the ads\nanalyzed in this thesis from the Trump official Facebook page.\nBecause there was no way to gather all the Facebook post advertisements, I also had\nto go page-by-page to find relevant advertisements. Advertisements were chosen for the\nhighest number of interactions (likes and comments combined, e.g., 3467 likes + 1435\ncomments = value), non-repeated advertisement information, and as close as possible to the\nelections date (November 8th, 2016). This was to ensure that the advertisements represented\nthe campaign in its final stages, which was considered to be the most important.\nThis group consisted of 25 advertisements in total to match the corresponding groupone, and to comply with the methodological guide lines.\n3.2.3 Group-three\nFor the two remaining groups, groups-three and four, these two groups represented\nthe TV commercials in both campaigns (Vote Leave and Trump 2016 Presidential\nCampaign). Group three represented the Vote Leave campaign. This group consisted of 10 of\nthe TV ads that were aired on national television in the UK during the Brexit referendum\nevent in 2016. These ads were found on the official Vote Leave Campaign’s YouTube\nchannel as a secondary attempt. The first attempt was to find a reliable source that would\nprovide more data about the advertisements (e.g., number of times aired, estimated views,\netc.). Therefore, the TV ads that represented Vote Leave (group three) were sampled using\npurposeful sampling from YouTube. The sampling process was intended to be on the number\nof views on YouTube as the main aspect to look for, under the assumption that ads with the\nhighest amount of views and interactions are likely to be the ones that most resonated with\nthe people when it was aired on national TV. During the sampling process, however, only 10\nadvertisements were found on the official Vote Leave YouTube channel. Therefore, all 10\nadvertisements were included in this group.\n3.2.4 Group-four\nFor group four, that represented the Trump TV ads, this group was sampled from a\nwebsite that provided fact-checks on the content of the ads (politicalarchive.org). The website\n37
did not only provide the ads that were aired during the Trump Campaign, but also provided\nsome additional information that was previously mentioned.\nBecause the Trump campaign involved different phases, such as going through the\nRepublican Party elections process to get the party’s nomination, the media messages\ninvolved were not the same as in the Vote Leave case. This difference between the two\ncampaigns’ TV ads airing strategy was due to the difference between the TV industry in both\ncountries. To illustrate, the UK has a national broadcast, allowing advertisers to reach,\ntheoretically, the whole nation. On the other hand, the TV industry in the US is highly\nprivatized, and the federal government in the US does not subsidize a national broadcast.\nTherefore, to ensure that the groups three and four are as close as possible, ads in group four\nwere chosen based on the closest it was to the election’s day. By focusing on the ads made\nfor the final stage of the elections, the ads selected were automatically designed for the whole\ncountry, rather than focusing on ads that were designed for state level purposes. For example,\nan ad made to target a ‘red state’ such as Texas, will likely be different than one designed to\ntarget a ‘blue state’ such as California, that is a strong hold for the Republican Party. Finally,\nads for group three and for were 20 in total complying with the methodological guidelines.\n3.3
Operationalization\nThe operationalization phase consisted of setting a systematic way to measure the
concept of persuasion techniques. As reviewed in the theoretical framework, persuasion\ntechniques in the populist communication style are quite clear in some areas. Therefore, some\nsub-concepts were developed from the theoretical framework to measure the persuasion\ntechniques. What follows sheds light on how persuasion techniques were measured and refers\nto the authors previously reviewed.\n3.3.1 Text motivation\nThe analysis started off by identifying the text motivation behind the text. In this\nsegment, the sample units were examined for the purpose behind their creation. To ensure\nthat this was conducted in a systematic manner, the outcome of this segment was determined\nby asking the following questions: who is the producer of this ad? (e.g., the main campaign,\nor does it refer to a politician such as ads that were signed by Boris Johnson); why was this\nad created? (e.g., to set the reader’s agenda about an issue such as immigration); where was it\nused and when?; does the ad appeal to fear? as referred to by Norris and Inglehart (2019);\ndoes the ad appeal to people’s frustration (economy and income, immigration, culture and\nreligious values)? as referred to by Jarvis (2017); does the ad aim at building authenticity by\n38
appealing to emotionalization as referred to by Lilleker (2006)?. By knowing the text\nmotivation, it was easier to define the targeted audience, thus, determining the rhetorical\nfunction of the ad. The question about the intended audience was answered as a part of the\nfollowing segment.\n3.3.2 Advertisement Type\nIn this segment the answer to which category the ad falls in was determined based on\na predefinition that was made to infer how the audience may receive the ads ((Lilleker, 2006;\nBelt, 2017). The understanding of the type of ads used and categorizing them according to\ntheir overall functions, it was easier to identify the campaign’s intentions and strategies,\nwhich in turn, is an important part of the persuasion process.\nThis process was done in two attempts. The first was an attempt to divide the\naudience based on their political affiliation, e.g., in the US case, Republicans, Democrats and\nFloat-voters, which refers to undetermined voters. This attempt was problematic for two\nreasons. The first, because of how divisive this election in the U.S. was in particular, and that\nmany members of a party decided to vote from a candidate from another party. For example,\nstudies found that 4% of Republicans voted for Clinton, and 5% of Democrats have voted for\nTrump (PEW research center, 2018). While this percentage seems to be small, it suggests that\nreaders can be critical about the information they receive in political communication and\nfrom the media. Second, While Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent, was an active member of\nthe Democratic Party and held an official title in the federal government, Trump on the other\nhand, was only a member of the Republican Party, unlike Clinton, with no official political\nrole, making him an ‘outsider’. This difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in\nterms of being involved in the political system, in addition to Trump being a populist\ncandidate, has mad the categorization of the audience troubling in terms of the results of this\nparticular part of the analysis.\nThe UK example illustrates better the logic behind this choice. In the first attempt,\nthe audience were divided based also on their political affiliation to so that the UK dataset\nwould match its counterpart dataset from the U.S. This was also problematic in terms of the\noutcome of the analysis. The audience at first were divided into Conservatives, members of\nthe Conservative Party; Labors, members of the Labor Party, that forms with the\nConservative Party the two main pillars of the UK political system; and, the float-voters,\nmembers of other minor Parties and/ or those with no clear political affiliation. This was also\nproblematic learning that both Boris Johnson, the leader of the Vote Leave Campaign was a
39
Conservative, working against the Remain Campaign, that was led by David Cameron the\nUK Prime Minister at the time, who was also a Conservative. Which suggests that there were\ntwo wings inside the Conservative Party that had different visions for the UK’s future in the\nEU. Therefore, similarly, as in the US case, I chose to divide the audience, not based on their\npolitical affiliation, but rather, to their individual take on the Brexit referendum. This resulted\nin categorizing the audience in the UK into Brexiteers, people that are strongly in favor of the\nUK leaving the EU, also described as Eurosceptics (Hobolt, 2016); non-Brexiteers, people\nthat are not in favor of the UK leaving the EU and want it to Remain; and finally, floatvoters, those who do not have strong opinions about Brexit and were still making their\ndecision about what to vote.\nThe following of this second categorization logic, - I found, has led to a more useful\naccount of how people in both countries would receive the ads, and thus, allowed to infer in a\nmore reliable manner what the ads creators were intending during the creation of the ads from\nit. This was particularly useful while analyzing advertisements when the attacks launched\nwere indirect, at least to one or more of the described audience categories. For example, the\nVote Leave ads that mentioned other countries names claiming that they will join the EU, and\nmaking comparisons between the annual wages in the UK and these countries, to a Brexiteer,\nthis ad is likely to be considered an advocacy ad because of how the attack is left for the\nreader to infer based on their personal background.\nThe ads fell in one out of three categorize as defined by Lilleker (2006). The\nfollowing questions determined which category the ads fell into. Who the subject of the ad?\n(Sponsor/ opponent/ both). In the case of the ad focusing on the sponsor, the ad is marked as\nan advocacy ad; if the ad is focused on the opponent, the ad is marked as a negative ad; in the\ncase where the ads focuses on both and in making comparisons, the ad is coded as a contrast\nad.\n3.3.3 Text analysis\nThe next stage was to conduct the text analysis. In this stage, the text content of the\nFacebook ads and the TV ads were analyzed for their rhetorical appeals as a means to\npersuading readers. This analysis was conducted in a theoretically informed manner. For\nexample, the text would be analyzed by looking for the three rhetorical proofs of logos, ethos,\nand pathos as mentioned by Yunis (2018). To illustrate, the analysis was conducted by\nlooking in every sentence for a rhetorical appeal. To make the analysis as systematic as\npossible, a set of questions were answered, and the answers determined the latent or manifest
40
rhetorical appeals. This was particularly useful in the cases where the rhetorical appeals were\nnot clear. For example, in some cases, it was not clear enough if the author -agent- was\nappealing to emotions (pathos) or reasoning (logos) from the first round of coding, and the\nguiding question helped determine which appeal was more salient.\nTable 1: How to measure rhetorical appeals\nRhetorical

Nationalism: the use of words that imply inclusion such as:

Initially, I tried Atlas.ti software to conduct the analysis of the sample. Due to that I\nwas not able to categorize the measured sub-concepts during the analysis, I started to upload\nthe Facebook advertisements on Word Office and made a table to include the concepts. This\nwas a better solution; however, it was still insufficient in terms of including all the concepts\nin one table. Therefore, I used Office Excel. Then, I assigned a code for every advertisement\nthat corresponds to its group and sequence. For example, advertisement number 2.14, the first\nnumber (2) indicates that the advertisement falls in group-two (Trump Facebook\nadvertisements), and the second number (14) indicates the advertisement’s sequence in its\ngroup.\n3.3.4 Visual analysis\nThe next analysis method was the visual analysis, that together with the text analysis,\nforms the multimodal analysis for the Facebook ads in group one and two. Due to the size of\nthis thesis, this was not conducted in groups three and four, unless something significant\nneeded to be added. The visual analysis examined the images that complimented the text\npresent in the Facebook ads. The analysis started by looking first at what is in focus in the\n41
image, then looked at the background that might be blurred but still have some meaning, for\nexample, a blurred American flag or the EU flag. The combination of the rhetorical analysis\nof the text and the visual analysis resulted in identifying the presented appeals in these ads. In\nsome cases, the focus was on one rhetorical appeal, this was especially present in the ads that\nhad a strong nationalistic appeal (pathos), e.g., an American flag behind Trump.\n3.3.5 Rhetorical strategies\nThe next step was to identify the salient rhetorical strategies in the text. These rhetorical\nstrategies are part of the persuasion techniques used with readers. This was done by weighing\nand identifying the types of arguments present in the text to determine its logic. This helped\nin identifying the seven rhetorical strategies that are usually present in online disinformation\ncampaigns as identified by Alphillipie et al. (2018). The first form of arguments is the\ndeductive argument. This type of arguments is structured in a way where if the premises are\ntrue, the conclusion must be true (Goel, Gold, Kapur & Houle, 1997). For example, if A=B,\nand B=C, therefore, A=C. This is the simplest form of a deductive argument. Deductive\narguments can be valid or invalid arguments. A valid argument is a sort of deductive\narguments where the correctness of the premises determines the correctness of the conclusion\nof the argument. For example, Tom is a man. All men are mortal. Therefore, Tom is mortal.\nThis argument is valid because the premises used are true. On the other hand, invalid\narguments are the ones that have the structure of a deductive argument, however, contain\nfalse reasoning because the premises are not true. For example, all those who like fishing are\nalive. Mark is alive. Therefore, Mark likes fishing. In this argument the premises are correct,\nhowever, the conclusion does not fall logically from the argument, therefore, the argument is\ninvalid. Further, a deductive argument can be a sound or an unsound argument (Fohr, 1979).\nFor a deductive argument to be sound, all premises of the argument must be true, and the\nargument is valid (Fohr, 1979). For example, Rotterdam is in the Netherlands. Sarah is in\nRotterdam. Therefore, Sarah is in the Netherlands. This argument is a sound argument\nbecause the premises are true and valid. An argument can be valid but unsound, for example,\nRotterdam is in Belgium. Sarah is in Rotterdam. Therefore, Sarah is in Belgium. This\nargument is valid because the conclusion falls logically from the premises. However, the first\npremise is not true that Rotterdam is in Belgium. Therefore, the argument is not sound.\nAnother type of arguments is the inductive arguments. Inductive arguments are the ones built\non the notion that the strength of the premises increases the likelihood of having a correct\nconclusion (Fohr, 1979). For example, eleven apples out of twelve in the bag are red apples.
42
Tom will pick an apple at random from the bag. Therefore, Tom will pick a red apple. This is\nan example of an inductive argument that is also a strong argument. However, the strength of\nan argument is relative from a person to another and is determined according to prior beliefs\n(Fohr, 1979). Furthermore, inductive arguments, including to being strong or weak\narguments, they can be cogent or non-cogent arguments. For an argument to be cogent, it has\nto have true premises and the premises must be strong (Fohr, 1979). For example, most\npeople in the Netherlands like eating fries. Rotterdam is in the Netherlands. Therefore, a\nrandomly chosen person in Rotterdam will like fries. The use of the word most indicates that\nnot all people in the Netherlands like fries, thus, not making an absolute generalization. Also,\nthe argument is built in a way to convince the interpreter that there is a high probability due\nto that most of the people in the Netherlands like fires. Therefore, increasing the chance of\nconvincing the interpreter with the argument by increasing the likelihood of the premises.\nTherefore, this argument is strong and cogent.\nBy identifying the type or arguments used in the advertisements, I was able to identify\nsome of the rhetorical strategies in the advertisements. Lying, is a common rhetorical strategy\nin online disinformation (Alphillipie et al, 2019). By identifying type of argument and then\nidentifying the correctness of the premises, it was easier to identify rhetorical strategies such\nas lying. While most ads were categorized as disinformation in the two studied cases, this\nform of analysis helped identify other rhetorical strategies that were interwoven with lying\n(e.g., cherry picking and ad hominem.
3.3.6 General tone\nFor the general tone used in the ads, this was determined according to the choice of\nwords, and/or tone. For example, does the text address the readers in a formal manner? This\nwas determined by the language used in the text. For example, does the advertisement\naddress the readers collectively? (if the answer is yes, the ad would been coded as using a\nformal tone). Also, the general tone determined by the tone voice that was used in terms of\nthe first/second or third person. Finally, does the agent speak using words that imply\ninclusion such as we, us, our, and own? and so on and so forth. Identifying the general tone\nhelped in supporting the rhetorical appeals analysis of the text. For example, the use of the\nformal tone sometimes indicated the use of (knowledge) authority appeals (ethos).
43
3.3.7 Counterevidence\nNext, was the look for counter evidence in both the texts and the visuals. The main\nfocus was to find if any component of the ad may imply a different interpretation or appeal\ndifferently than the one that is most salient, and therefore, was labeled to the text or visual as\ncounterevidence.
3.3.8
Thematic analysis\nThematic analysis is one of the qualitative research methods that allows finding
patterns and meanings in texts that would otherwise be invisible (Boeije, 2010). Furthermore,\nit allows to capture explicit and implicit themes in a text (Braun and Clarke, 2006; Boeije,\n2010). I decided to add thematic analysis as a second aryanalysis method to support the\nresults for the rhetorical analysis when applicable and was conducted for the Facebook ads\nonly (groups one and two). This was due to the size of this project and to the large size of the\nTV ads analyzed.\nThematic analysis in this research was conducted by applying the Grounded Theory\napproach. That is, to drive the analysis from what emerges from the data rather than existing\nliterature (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). In other words, the analysis was done in an inductive\nmanner in which the codes emerge from the data. Unlike the rhetorical analysis where the\nanalysis is conducted in a deductive way by looking for the specific features of the persuasion\nproofs (ethos, logos, and pathos) or techniques that are theoretically informed. The\ncombination of the two methods, rhetorical analysis and thematic analysis, was chosen for the\npurpose of comparing the analysis outcome, a process known as triangulation (Silverman,\n2011). This according to Silverman (2011) may increase the credibility of the research\nresults.
Open coding\nThe thematic analysis started in its first phase by capturing the main theme, if present,\nin every sentence of the text (Boeije, 2010). Furthermore, open coding of the text “is the\nprocess of ‘breaking down, examining, comparing, conceptualizing and categorizing data’”\n(Strauss & Corbin, 2007 as cited in Boeije, 2010, p. 96). This phase started by reading the\ntext to start the emerging process within the data (Boeije, 2010). This helped me getting\nfamiliar with the data being analyzed and therefore, be more aware of it. Next, the text was\nreread while paying attention to every theme present in, if any, in every sentence (Boeije,\n44
2010). This phase resulted in open codes that represent the main themes/ ideas that were\npresent either explicitly or implicitly in the data (Boeije, 2010).\nAxial coding\nThis is the second phase of the analysis. Boeije (2010) rationalizes the axial coding by\nacknowledging that “the primary purpose of axial coding is to determine which elements in\nthe research are dominant ones and which are less important ones” (p. 109). This phase has\nallowed not only to illeminate the redundant open codes that may have emerged in the first\nround of coding, but also allowed to find common themes that together start defining\nthematic patterns in the data. This phase resulted in thematic categories that were constructed\nfrom the open codes that were found to be relevant in answering the research question.\nSelective coding\nThe third and final phase is known as selective coding. This phase aims at defining\nany present relationships between the dominant themes that were previously identified and\nany possible concepts or main themes. This, Boeije (2010) argues, is achieved by identifying\nrepetitive themes, the main messages present in the data, and how they relate to each other.\nThe coding process was done on all four predefined groups separately, and the results\nof every group was compared the corresponding group. This helped define the shared themes\nthat were present in the four groups. By doing so, I was able to compare what each campaign\nfocused on in their messages. In turn, this revealed the general topics that shaped the major\nmedia strategy of each campaign.\n3.4
Reliability, validity and credibility
3.4.1 Credibility\nUnder the title “Critics of scientific credibility” (p. 353), Silverman (2011) weighted\nthe arguments made against the credibility of qualitative research. For example, critics argue,\naccording to Silverman (2011), that due to that scholars getting involved in a personal and\nintensive manner in the analysis process of qualitative data, which in turn, ultimately affects\nthe credibility of the scholar’s work. Silverman (2011) concluded that this claim is\nparadoxical and refuted it because this personal and intensive involvement also applies to\nquantitative research, regardless of the methodology, and if to be taken to be true, makes the\nnotion of research, redundant.\nIn this thesis, I was heavily overwhelmed with the sample for several reasons. First,\ncoming from the Middle East, and not being in the countries where the two events happened,\n45
I was only receiving information from media outlets. Because media outlets have editorial\npolicies that reflected on the content they produced, this entailed that my understanding of the\nevents was in a way or another affected by these media outlets’ opinions expressed by their\ncommentators. In other words, my personal construction of events, may relatively been\naffected by the construction of others related to the two campaigns. Therefore, I do indeed\nbelieve that this might have had an effect where I was, subconsciously and unintentionally,\nbiased against the two campaigns. I have adopted some ethical guidelines developed by Scott\n(1967) that I assumed will, in a systematic way, lower the chances of personal bias to reflect\nnegatively on the analysis of the sample. These guidelines will be presented shortly.\nSecondly, the lack of knowledge is relative, and when present, might easily distort the\noutcome of the analysis. What is problematic about the lack of knowledge is that a researcher\nis likely not be aware of it when it happens. The aforementioned ethical guideline had helped\nme overcome, I assume, many of the times where things were not clear, because I had to look\nfor outside sources (journalistic) to eliminate as much as I can the lack of knowledge. More\nillustration on this point will follow.\n3.4.2 Validity\nValidity refers to the extent to which the measurement of the data is accurate\n(Silverman, 2011). In other words, how accurate is the analysis process accurate in measuring\nthe data in the way it was intended to. Furthermore, Silverman (2011) assessed the notion of\nqualitative research validity and concluded that due to the interpretive nature of the data in\nqualitative research, including quantitative research, validity in qualitative research is, to\nvarious degrees, achievable. Moreover, the use of triangulation in the form of combining both\nrhetorical and thematic analysis provided a more structural approach and deeper insight\nduring the analysis.\nFinally, it is important to note here, that Silverman (2011) pointed out, among other\nthings, to the role that the researcher’s personal values play in the process of interpreting\ndata. Giving the nature of the datasets of this research being connected to populist groups\nfrom the UK and the US that are known for being hostile, in their discourse, against people\nthat come from certain regions (e.g., South America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, etc.),\nethnicities (e.g., Black or Brown), religious groups (e.g., Muslims and Jews), it was clear to\nmyself that personal bias might reflect consciously or unconsciously on the interpretation of\nthe sample.
46
Populist politicians, especially those that hold authoritarian values such as Donald\nTrump, tend to gain political power over their opponents by agitating the masses against the\npolitical establishment in a country (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). My personal view on\ndemocracy extends beyond people’s vote to the unwritten social contracts of mutual living. I\nadopt the definition of democracy by Norris and Inglehart (2019) where these unwritten\nsocial agreements in a democratic society includes mutual tolerance, culture of acceptance,\nand is a society that is constantly keen to protect itself from extremist culture/s. Also, I see\ndemocracy as a system in which ethnic and religious minorities are protected and are\nempowered to live a ‘normal’ life including, among other things, the participation in the\npolitical system. This entails that the society, as I see it, should reject populist movements\nthat holds authoritarian values (e.g., xenophobia) that constantly focus their hate speech on\nspecific groups in order to gain political power.\nDuring the analysis of the sample, I indeed encountered some ads that used, what I\nconsider, hate speech against others. I tried as much as I could to be aware of this, and not\nmaking my personal views on democracy affect the interpretation of the sample.\n3.4.3 Reliability\n“Reliability refers to the degree to which the findings of a study are independent of\naccidental circumstances of their production” (Kirk & Miller, 1986 as cited in Silverman,\n2011, p. 360). In other words, reliability in qualitative research is related to both the\nmeasurements used in the analysis, and therefore, to what extent the study is replicable; and\nthe circumstances that may affect the interpretation. For example, a scale that gives the same\nmeasurement for the same person every time is a reliable scale. Assuming no other changes\nin the person’s weight, and that the scale is correct, or, valid. And because qualitative\nresearch is different than scales, according to Moisander and Valtonen (2006) as cited in\nSilverman (2011), a qualitative researcher should be transparent about the analysis process so\nthe reader of the research report would be able to judge how reliable the findings of the\nresearch are. Furthermore, a researcher should make explicit their theoretical stance on topics\nthat emerge during the analysis by paying attention to the used theoretical framework.\nTherefore, I have relied on the guidelines developed by Scott (1967) in his thesis, rhetoric as\nepistemic, to remedy any personal biases, lack of knowledge or other inside or outside factors\nthat might risk the integrity and reliability of the interpretation of the sample.
47
3.4.4 Rhetoric-as-epistemic\nSuch concerns discussed in the reliability section were also at the center of Scott’s\n(1967) essay titled ‘On viewing rhetoric as epistemic’. As just mentioned, I relayed on the\nguidelines developed by Scott (1967) that, realistically, if applied, safeguards, to a large\nextent, the reliability of a research that rhetorical analysis is its main analysis method. Scott\n(1967) argued that knowledge is never certain and, absolute certainty is not achievable due to\ndifferent factors. For example, he stated facts such as that knowledge can be limited, partial\nand changing. Also, he pointed that rhetoric is usually involved in debates that is naturally\ninvolved in struggle, conflict and disagreement. Therefore, Scott (1967) concluded that\nrhetoric is contingent and thus, no matter how systematic the analysis of the text is, it will\ncontain flaws. Accordingly, Scott (1967) defined a set of ethical guidelines that will improve\nthe rhetorical analysis of a studied text. The ethical guidelines provided by Scott (1967) are\nas follows: toleration, that is, to be open for the best possible interpretation in favor of the\nauthor of the text, he explains “ on the other hand, uncertainty, taking truth as a toehold to\nclimb into the yet-to-be-created rather than is a program to unfold regardless of the\ncircumstances, demands toleration” (p.16). The next guideline is will, that is the intention one\nhas to learn and act, or as Scott (1967) puts it “if one cannot be certain, however, then one\nmust either withdraw form conflicts of life or find some way to act in the face of these\nconflicts” (p. 16). Finally, responsibility, that is, that one must be responsible to “make his\nacts the best possible” (p. 17) in the case of working in uncertain situations. These ethical\nguidelines were implemented during the analysis of the texts to ensure, on the most basic\nlevel, avoiding personal bias as much as possible.

Results\nIn this section, I underscore the rhetorical techniques and functions, including the
rhetorical appeals, used by each campaign in the sample. Then, I review the results of the\nthematic analysis that answer the main research question of this thesis. First, it is important to\nnote that the majority of the ads analyzed have been fact-checked by independent and/or\nofficial bodies and were categorized as containing disinformation news.\n5.1
Group 1\nRhetorical techniques\nRhetorical functions\nGroup one consisted of the dark ads on Facebook from both the Vote Leave
Campaign and the BeLeave Campaign analyzed to answer the sub-question: What were the\nrhetorical techniques used by the Vote Leave Campaign during the Brexit referendum in the\nUK in 2016 in their Facebook advertisements?\nThe answer to this question was determined by several factors that took place during\nthe analysis phases. The rhetorical functions of the ads in this group centered around setting\nthe reader’s agenda about how harmful the EU was to the UK. This was done in the attempt\nto persuade the reader that the EU is a ‘corrupt system’ that is severely harming the UK on\nmany levels. The final conclusion about this group is that the Vote Leave Campaign relied\nheavily on rhetorical techniques that provided short and focused information that stroke\ncertain cords. The main rhetorical technique was the emotionalization of the reader’s\nexperience (nationalism and anger) to mobilize the public opinion in the UK against the EU,\nmainly by feeding people’s anger in terms of controversial topics. By doing so, the Vote\nLeave Campaign was likely aiming at 1) establishing trust with the readers by showing\nthemselves as caring for and on the same side as the voters, thus providing reason why the\nvoters should trust the campaign and that the UK should leave the EU; and 2) shaping the\nreader’s perception that the EU is a burden on the UK in the form of deregulating\nimmigration, restricting the UK’s sovereignty, draining its economy and diminishing its\nyounger generations’ future opportunities.\nThe advertisements were also focused on feeding the reader’s negativity bias and\nappealed to certain strong emotions. The short and focused information that discussed topics\nof high sophistication such as immigration that entails ideology, culture and economy were\ndeliberately discussed in a superficial and an abstract style. The feeding of the negativity bias
49
was linked to the immense use of first-order principles in the advertisements and during the\nabsence of reliable information about second-order principles.\nFigure 1: example of the multimodal analysis (kindly zoom in to be able to read content)
Type of advertisements\nTo non-Brexiteers and float-voters, the ads were remarkably negative (attack)\nadvertisements. The use of negative ads was linked to the first aim of establishing trust with\nthe reader by ushering the reader to the negative impacts of the EU on the UK in a direct or\nindirect way. Negative ads in group-one seemed to focus the attacks related to economy and\nUK taxpayers’ money on three different levels. The first level was to attack the integrity of\nthe EU by targeting the integrity of the very people that compose the EU itself (officials and\nbureaucrats). The aim of the attacks launched on this level were likely to create and/or feed\nthe UK citizens’ anger on economic grounds which entailed the extensive use of appeals to\nreasoning (logos), and the strong emotions of anger, fear, and prejudice (pathos). For\nexample, ads 1.14 and 1.15.
50
Figure 2: ad 1.14
Figure 3: ad 1.15
The second level was to target the EU also based on economy and tax money;\nhowever, the attacks were in an indirect way. The aim of these ads was apparently to create\npublic anger against the EU like on the first level but added a layer of sophistication by\n51
adding the immigration topic to it. By adding the immigration topic to these ads, the agent\n(content creator) was likely aiming at feeding the reader’s negativity bias, fear and prejudice.\nThe main rhetorical appeals were reasoning (logos), explicitly, and emotions (pathos) of fear\nand anger, implicitly. For example, in ads 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.
Figure 4: ad 1.6
Figure 5: ad 1.7
52
Figure 6: ad 1.8
The third level were also indirect attack ads on the EU that asked the UK citizens to\nstop sending the UK money to the EU or potential EU countries, and that this is achieved by\nthe UK leaving the EU which will allow the UK government to spend their money on the UK\ncitizens instead. The aim of this set of ads was to appeal to the UK citizen’s reasoning (logos)\nby contrasting their own interest against the interest of the people of EU member states or\nyet-to-be member states. In this level, the appeal to nationalism and anger (pathos) were the\nmost salient, parallelly, was the appeal to reasoning (logos). For example, in ad 1.2 “LET’S\nGIVE THE NHS THE £350 MILLION WE HAND OVER TO THE EU EVERY WEEK [in\nthe background a crowded hospital with a doctor that seems to be form a Middle Eastern\ndecent, looking in charge while what seems to be a Caucasian British doctor with a\nstethoscope is at the counter doing administrative work which gives the reader a sense of\nchaos in the British health system (NHS) due to its membership in the EU. A faded image of\nthe administrative workers that appear to be two Muslim females wearing Hijab to appeal to\nanger against immigration in the UK due to the membership of the EU]”.
53
Figure 7: ad 1.2
Also, in ad 1.3 the agent is both appealing to knowledge authority (ethos) by\nmentioning figures, and to reasoning (logos) by providing alternative solutions to what they\nportray as problems in the face of the UK “STOP sending £350 million to the EU every\nsingle week. Spend it on our priorities instead. [ The EU flag faded in the background]”.\nFigure 8: ad 1.3
Similarly, in one of the BeLeave Campaign ads (1.25) “We send £10 billion to the\nEU every year. Let’s spend it on out priorities instead. [In the background an image that\nseems to be taken from the iconic London Bridge looking over the London Eye, Big Ben and\nother historical buildings of London such as the British Parliament, in an attempt to appeal to\nnationalism (pathos)]”.\n54
Figure 9: ad 1.25
Rhetorical appeals\nHere I review the results of the multimodal analysis of the texts and visuals of the ads\nanalyzed.\nIt is important to note here that the appeal to credibility (ethos) was intertwined and\nwas always used in combination with other appeals. The appeal to speaker credibility (ethos)\nwas not repeated in the ads as much as the other two appeal (logos and pathos), however, due\nto the inherent rhetorical function of the ads serving as enthymemes, the light use of\nknowledge authority (ethos) was considerably focused and perhaps, effective. Enthymeme is\nunderstood here as the absence of a premise in the argument that the agent assumes the reader\nis aware of regardless of their agreement or disagreement on the topics discussed and, is a\nform of deductive reasoning with the reader that allows the agent to make unsupported claims\n(Yunis, 2018). Therefore, the appeals to speaker credibility (ethos), especially in the form of\nappealing to knowledge authority was, despite of the limited use, an effective way to\ncommunicate with Brexiteers on one side, and float-voters on the other. The effectiveness of\nknowledge authority on Brexiteers was for the rhetorical function of feeding confirmation\nbias, because of the information it provided, and on float-voters by attempting to shape their\nperceptions about how reliable the Vote Leave Campaign politicians are form one side, and\ntheir perceptions on the topics discussed on the other. In other words, the agent used the\ncredibility appeals (ethos) in a propagandist manner to create social barriers between UK\nvoters on the aforementioned main topics (economy, immigration and UK’s future in the EU)\nbetween the three categories of voters.\n55
For the ads that appealed to fear about the future were mainly the ads made by the\nBeLeave Campaign that were set to target the younger voters. The use of fear appeals,\nhowever, was not straightforward, especially when combining the texts with the background\nimages on the ads. In these ads, the agent used negative texts in combination with positive\nbackground images, which was confusing in the multimodal analysis phase (e.g., ad 1.17).\nThe appeal to emotions (based on topics) were complemented with appeals to reasoning\n(logos). It was common among the BeLeave Campaign ads that it did not contain any direct\nslogans or instructions that urged the reader’s to ‘vote leave’. These ads were likely designed\nas a window to draw the readers’ attention to specific topic (agenda-setting). Markable in\nthese ads is how they also were used for voter-learning. For example, in ad 1.16 “We should\nmake our laws, not far away, unelected bureaucrats. [click link to] LEARN MORE [in the\nbackground a large leg wearing the Union Jack flag kicking a small sized man holding the\nEU flag in his hands]”. The use of words such as (we and our) were used to give the reader a\nsense of collectivity and appeals to nationalism.
Figure 10: 1.16
Also, in ad 1.17 “We need an immigration system that ensures British young people\nmore jobs [click the link] I AGREE [in the background a young brown British female that\nlooks from a different origin smiling while being in a metro train]” (own emphasis).\nSimilarly, ad 1.22 “The EU is restricting us from unleashing the kind of innovation which\ncreates jobs and grows our economy [a man looking like a businessman holding a briefcase\n56
while chained to an iron ball that has the EU flag]” (own emphasis). Besides the light\nemotionalization function of these ads, the main function appeared to be agenda setting and\nvoter-learning.
Figure 11: ad 1.17
The deference of the language used between the Vote Leave Campaign\nadvertisements and the BeLeave Campaign advertisements is that the latter were attempting\nto reason with the younger generations more than directing them -even if it contained\ndisinformation- while the former were more instructive for the older generations to leave the\nEU. This deference in the language used marked the different political strategies employed to\ncommunicate with the different generations of voters, thus, marking the different approaches\nof ad design. In other words, the BeLeave Campaign ads were more advocacy ads than\nnegative ads due to the type of audience they were appealing to. Moreover, the BeLeave ads\nseemed to be more effective in voter-learning because it functioned on two levels. The first is\nthe visible ad with the information it conveyed; the second was the button containing the\nhyperlink (e.g., “LEARN MORE”) which allowed the reader to move to another webpage\nthat contained more information about the topic discussed in the original ad. On the other\nhand, while the Vote Leave ads also contained hyperlink buttons, they were mostly\ncorresponding to the information provided in the ads itself (e.g., “JOIN ME, VOTE LEAVE”\nor “STOP THE EU NOW!”), thus, the agent seemed to assume that the reader is already in\nagreement with the information provided on the ads of the Vote Leave Campaign ads, thus,\nseemed to assume the reader was in consent with the information provided.\n57
Finally, while Both Vote Leave and BeLeave campaigns were related and led by the\nsame people, it was clear from the advertisements in group-one that the Vote Leave\nCampaign ads were much more negative (attack) ads than the BeLeave ones.\nThematic analysis\nThe thematic analysis of Facebook advertisements in group-one revealed the main\nmessages the Vote Leave Campaign and its sub-campaign BeLeave focused on during their\ncampaigning through the Brexit event. These topics were categorized under the selective\ncodes national threats and UK’s future. The two selective themes correspond to the results of\nthe multimodal rhetorical analysis of this group on how the ads were used to set the reader’s\nagenda around specific topics in order to mobilize the public opinion in the UK against the\nEU. The prioritizing of these topics reinforces the notion that the Vote Leave Campaign\naimed at emotionalizing the reader’s experience to win them on their side, and thus, gain\npolitical support despite that the initial codes of this group at first sight revealed the strong\nreasoning aspect of the ads.\nNational threats\nAds in group-one suggest that the EU possesses national threats to the UK and its own\nsovereignty. These threats pointed to by the Vote Leave Campaign were in the form of\nunregulated immigration, EU restrictions on various levels, and the lack of control over laws\nimposed by the European Parliament set by “unelected bureaucrats” (ad. 1.16).\nBy framing the EU as a threat, the Vote Leave Campaign framed the EU as negative,\nharmful and is in conflict with the UK’s interest. This anti-European sentiment that likely\nsought to scotomize the Brexiteers and float-voters against the non-Brexiteers not only by\nemotionalizing the reader’s experience but also by blocking information about the benefits\nthe UK gets in return of its membership in the EU.\nThe emotionalization of the readers were identified based on the topics the ads\ndiscussed. This emotionalization was mainly on two levels. The first was nationalistic in\nnature. For example, regaining control which was one of the highly repeated themes and was\nnot only repeated in the Vote Leave Campaign’s slogan “Vote Leave, Take Control” or “Vote\nLeave, Take Back Control”, but also in the content of the ads. In ad 1.12 “Immigration must\nbe controlled by those who the public elect and not the EU! On the 23 June they will get their\nchance to take back control”. This ad also provides a good example of how the topics\ndiscussed in the ads were multidimensional as the ad discussed immigration, lack of control\non laws, and regaining control. Also, the same ad encapsulates how first-order principles\nwere used.\n58
The second level of emotionalization was framing the EU as a source of constant\nthreat. For example, in ad 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 that aimed to raise the readers’ levels of\nanxiety and fear.\nTable 2: Thematic analysis codes\nSelective

UK’s future\nThe second selective theme that emerged from the data was suggested by the\nimmense focus on how the UK would look like outside of the EU. The campaign -especially\nthe BeLeave Campaign ads, focused of showing a bright image of the UK outside of the EU.\nThis was attributed to the targeted audience of this sub-campaign in the first place. This\ntheme was mainly used in the ads that seemed more positive to the Brexiteers, while slightly\nseemed to be attack ads for the non-Brexiteers and float-voters.
59
The emotionalization of the readers through framing a bright UK’s future outside the\nEU was of high frequency in the BeLeave ads, which was also attributed to the age segment\nthat this campaign targeted.
5.2
Group two\nRhetorical techniques\nGroup two consisted of the Facebook’s post advertisements that were available on the
official Donald Trump Facebook Page. These ads were analyzed to answer the sub-question:\nwhat were the rhetorical techniques used by the Trump presidential campaign during the\nUnited States Presidential Elections in 2016 in their Facebook posts advertisements?\nRhetorical functions\nThe rhetorical functions of these ads centered also around setting the readers agenda\nabout certain topics and, feeding both negativity and confirmation bias. The agenda-setting\ntechnique was used to persuade the readers that Donald Trump is credible enough -by\nappealing to knowledge authority (ethos)- to become president of the U.S. and ‘bring back\nthe American glory’; the other side of the agenda-setting was done by focusing the ads,\nsometimes specified and the others more general and abstract, on issues with Hillary Clinton\nin terms of personal ability and integrity. Voter-learning was an essential part of the ads that\nattacked Clintons ability and integrity, at least in the ads that contained more specified\ninformation. By doing so, the Trump 2016 Campaign was likely aiming at: 1) shaping the\nreader’s perception about Clinton as an ‘insider politician’ that is corrupt and lacks ability to\nperform the presidential tasks; and simultaneously 2) build the credibility of Trump as a\ntrustworthy candidate that would be able to perform the presidential tasks.\nIt is important to note here that in this group, the rhetorical functions (voter-learning,\nemotional appeals, and agenda-setting) were highly interwoven, and were all employed in the\nnegative (attack) ads that will be reviewed shortly.\nThe final conclusion about this group is that: 1) the Trump campaign weaponized\nthese ads to launch strong personal attacks on Hillary Clinton on several levels from one side;\nand 2) to build Trump’s image as a trustworthy candidate from the other.\nType of advertisements\nMore than half of the ads were explicit attack ads to all readers’ categories (proTrump, pro-Hillary, and float-voters). Unlike the attack on an official body in group-one
60
(EU), the attacks in group-two were personalized against Clinton on many levels. The first\nlevel was the attack on Clinton’s personal ability to hold office. This was in the attempt to\npersuade the reader that Clinton is not able to perform the tasks the presidential office entails.\nFor example, ad 2.4 “HILLARY’S ACCOMPLISHMENTS AT THE STATE\nDEPARTMENT[:] WEAK Iran Deal [,] FAILED Russia Reset [,] FAILED Libya\nIntervention [,] FAILED Iraq Strategy [,] FAILED Pivot to Asia [,] SHADY Contracts [,]\nLACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY [,] CONFLICTS of Interest [,] NO TRANSPARENCY”.\nFigure 12: ad 2.4
The second level was to attack Hillary Clinton’s integrity. This level was likely\naiming at discrediting Clinton, and therefore, directing the reader to question if Clinton is the\nright choice to become the president of the U.S. Also, these ads were likely designed in this\nway for two reasons. First, to shape the reader’s perception about Clinton as a corrupt and\nselfish politician. Such as in the last ad (2.4) that also attacked Clinton’s personal integrity.\nSecond, as Donald Trump was, back then, new to politics with no official office experience,\nhe was discrediting Clinton by focusing on what he thought is true about her abuse of power\nfor personal gains. For example, in ad 2.10 “Hillary Clinton is an insider supported by\npowerful insiders ---ATTACKING AMERICANS--- who have absolutely no political\npower [signed] -DONALD J. TRUMP [the complementary visual is a cropped image of\nHillary’s face having estrange gestures]” (own emphasis). Additionally, “ATTACING\nAMERICANS” appeals to fear (pathos) and by putting all Americans in the face of danger,\n61
the Trump campaign is socializing the readers to act as a ‘tribe’ in the face of that danger as\nexplained by Norris and Inglehart (2019). Also, in ad 2.20 “GRANTED IMMUNITY: THE\nPEOPLE BEHIND THE EMAIL SCANDAL[.] PAUL COMBETTA [,] CHERYL MILLS\n[,] BRYAN PAGLIANO [,] HEATHER SAMUELSON [,] JOHN BENTEL [.] WHAT ARE\nTHEY HIDING? #CrookedHillaryStandard [in the visual, small sized photos of the\nmentioned persons and a larger picture of Hillary Clinton in black-and-white laughing to\nappeal to fear and anxiety]”.\nFigure 13: ad 2.10
Similarly, ad 2.23 “CLINTON AIDE WHO SET UP SECRET SERVER: PLEADS\nTHE 5TH AMENDMENT [.] RESUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 125 TIMES [.]\nREFUSES TO COMPLY WITH CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA[.] WHAT’S HILLARY\nHIDING?”. Markable, except for one ad, all ads that contained an image of Hillary Clinton\nwere either black-and-white, or grey imagery to appeal to fear and anxiety aligning with Belt\n(2017).\n62
The third level of attacks were used to ridicule and denounce Clinton and were also\nused to structure the opposition (Clinton) as ‘not fit for office’. This aligned with the\naccusations against right-winged politicians as being misogynistic in their discourse (Norris\nand Inglehart, 2019). By doing so, the agent (Trump 2016 Campaign) was appealing to\nknowledge authority (ethos). For example, ad 2.1 “SHE HAS BEEN OUT SMARTED -----AND------- OUT PLAYED WORSE THAN ANY PERSON IN ANY GOVERNMENT\n[signed] DONALD J. TRUMP [in the background an image of Hillary Clinton, in black-andwhite, leaning on the lectern to show her in a weak state, referring to her health issues as\ndescribed by Donald Trump on several occasions]”.\nFigure 14: ad 2.1
63
Also, in ad 2.2 “You talk but you don’t get anything done. [signed] Donald J.\nTrump [the background is a grey image of Hillary Clinton laughing in the bottom right corner\nof the ad to appeal to fear and anxiety]”.\nAdvocacy ads focused on what Trump has to offer to the American people. For\nexample, in ad 2.13 “Together we can save American Jobs, American Lives, and American\nfutures. [signed] Donald J. Trump.” (own emphasis). The repeated use of the word American\nunderscores the extensive appeal to nationalism and fear. Other ads focused on personal or\nnational security such as ad 2.14 “in the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism,\nNazism, and Communism. We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. [signed] Donald J.\nTrump”. Likewise, ad 2.3 “A NATION WITHOUT BOARDERS IS NO A NATION AT\nALL. *** WE MUST HAVE A WALL. THE RULE OF LAW MATTERS [signed]\nDONALD J. TRUMP [an image of Trump standing confident in front of a lectern giving a\nspeech, behind him is the American flag]” (own emphasis). The last two ads did not only\nappeal to nationalism, but also appealed and assumed the existence of the ‘tribe’ notion\nreferred to earlier by Norris and Inglehart (2019), mainly because of the appeal to fear and\ncollectivity by using words such as together, we, we will, and defeat.\nRhetorical appeals\nThe most used appeals were the appeal to credibility (ethos). This appeal, however,\nwas usually used indirectly. As explained earlier, by attacking Clinton, especially on a\npersonal level, the agent (Trump) was appealing to knowledge authority. In other words,\ninstead of the agent stating that the candidate, Donald Trump, is credible for the X and Y\nreasons, the agent would describe the opponent, Hillary Clinton, as untrustworthy by often\nputting the veracity of her statements and actions into question. Due to the agent attacking\nthe opponent, it is likely to be inferred by the reader that the agent is appealing to credibility\nin a reversed manner. For example, in the aforementioned ads (2.1, 2.2 and 2.4).\nOn the other hand, Trump used the positive ads to build his own credibility in a direct\nway by appealing, to knowledge authority and leadership respectively. For example, ad 2.7\n“DONALD TRUMP IS TAKING THE STAGE FOR *YOU* [an image of Trump looking\nconfidently towards the camera (audience’s eye) and behind him are his aids, including Steve\nBannon, to appeal to power, getting ready for a presidential debate or a presidential rally. The\nuse of the colors red, white and blue that are the colors of the American flag are used to\nsignify and appeal to nationalism]. Also, ads 2.13 and 2.14.
64
Figure 15: ad 2.7
Parallelly, the most used rhetorical appeal was the appeal to emotions (pathos). These\nappeals were fear, anxiety, and anger, respectively. For example, ad 2.5 “we will protect and\nsave our beautiful 2nd amendment. [signed] Donald J. Trump,” the agent in this ad is referring\nto a long history of debate that rises to the surface every time a mass shooting accident\nhappens in the US. This debate involves one of the rigid rights of bearing arms. The\nDemocrats, including Clinton are in favor of changing the 2nd amendment, while the\nRepublicans fiercely object to it and consider it a matter of national pride. And therefore, the\nagent, Donald Trump is appealing to nationalistic emotions (pathos). Or in ad 2.6 “Hillary\nClinton would create the most liberal Supreme Court in the history of the United States,” the\nagent in this ad is addressing non-liberals. In other words, addressing conservatives, and thus,
65
appealing to ideological (nationalistic) beliefs. Therefore, the agent is appealing to emotions\n(pathos).\nThe ads that only appealed to reasoning (logos) were the least used and were added in\ncombination to other appeals such as in ad 2.1 “she has been out smarted and out played\nworse than any person in any government. [signed] Donald J. Trump” the agent, besides\ndenouncing the opponent, he is also providing reasons not to vote for her, therefore,\nappealing to reason (logos) that she is not fit for the position.\nThematic analysis\nThe thematic analysis of the ads of this group reveled the main overarching themes\nthat corresponded to a large extent to the multimodal rhetorical analysis. The final themes\nthat resulted from the analysis were risk America and save America. These two main themes\ncorresponded to the results of the multimodal rhetorical analysis and were linked to the\nrhetorical strategies of 1) shaping the readers’ perception about how it would be harmful for\nthe people and the country to vote for Clinton (risk America); on the other hand, 2) build\nperceptions about how beneficial it would be to vote for Trump (save America) through the\nextensive use of emotionalization.\nRisk America\nThis main theme emerged mainly form negative (attack) ads. It focused on persuading\nthe readers that Clinton, through her long years of service on different places, mainly\nSecretary of State, was a corrupt politician and is untrustworthy. In ad 2.8 “Clinton’s\nMessage to Coal County: “We’re Going To Put A LOT Of Coal Miners and Coal Companies\nOUT OF BUSINESS.” showing her as a careless politician that would risk American’s jobs.\nAlso, in ad 2.11 “Obama-Clinton Foreign Policy [:] Dangerous nuclear deal WITH NUBER\nONE STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM. Paying Iran a SECRET $400 MILLION\nRANSOM. COMPROMISE THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.”, and in ad\n2.15 “[Putin whispering in Clinton’s ear while both smiling (agreeing to the content of the\nconversation) and the image is colored in a reddish tone to appeal to an evil conversation]\nBIG FAN OF THE WAY TOU TRY TO RIG ELECTIONS [signed Putin] DEFEAT\nCROOKED HILLARY [with handcuffs replacing the double o in the word crooked]”.\nBy showing Clinton as a corrupt and untrustworthy politician to the reader, Trump\nwas not only denouncing her, but also setting the stage for the readers on the following\ntheme.
66
Save America\nThis theme was mainly visible in the advocacy and the contrast ads available in this\ngroup and, was highly dependent on construction on the previous main theme (risk America).\nAs mentioned in the rhetorical analysis, Trump aimed at constructing an image of him as a\ntrustworthy leader to persuade the voters to vote for him. In ad 2.16 for example, “I AM\nASKING FOR THE SUPPORT OF ALL AMERICANS WHO WANT MORE\nOPPORTUNITY, HIGHER WAGES, SAFER COMMUNITIES, COMPETENT\nLEADERSHIP, AND HONEST GOVERNMENT [signed] DONALD J. TRUMP” the agent\nis constructing his image as the leader that will save the American people by doing the things\nhe promises to do in this ad. Similarly, in the contrast ad 2.24 “The Choice in November IS A\nCHOICE BETWEEN A CLINTON AGENDA THAT PUTS DONERS FIRST -OR- a New\nAgenda That Puts America First. [signed] DONALD J. TRUMP”. In this ad, the main theme\nwas to portray Clinton as a risky choice for the American people, while painting Trump as\nthe man that will put American interest first. And finally, in the advocacy ad 2.22 “[an\nAmerican soldier on duty in what seems to be Iraq with the U.S. Army pledge on top] I do\nsolemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all\nenemies”. In this last ad, next to that the agent is appealing to nationalism and national pride\n(country’s army), the agent is also showing to the reader that protecting the army and the\nAmerican power is one of his top priorities, therefore, showing the reader one way that by\nchoosing him is a way to save America.\n5.3
Group Three\nThis group consisted of the TV ads produced by the Vote Leave Campaign and were
aired on national television not too long before the referendum day. Due to the lack of\ninformation on how many times the ads were aired or viewed from a reliable source, the ads\nwere chosen based on the number of interactions on YouTube. This was under the\nassumption that the ads that would most resonate with people on YouTube would be also the\none that were aired on national TV. This group was formed to answer the sub-question: what\nwere the rhetorical techniques used by the Vote Leave Campaign during the Brexit\nreferendum in the UK in 2016 in their television advertisements?
67
Rhetorical techniques\nRhetorical functions\nSimilar to group-one, the rhetorical functions of the ads in this group centered around\nsetting the reader’s agenda about how harmful the EU was to the UK. This was done in the\nattempt to persuade the reader that the EU is a ‘corrupt system’ that is severely harming the\nUK on many levels. The final conclusion about this group is that the Vote Leave Campaign\nrelied heavily on rhetorical techniques that provided focused information that stroke the same\ncords as in their dark ads. The main rhetorical technique was the emotionalization of the\nreader’s experience (nationalism, anger and fear) to mobilize the public opinion in the UK\nagainst the EU, mainly by feeding people’s anger by setting their agenda on controversial\ntopics. What was different in this group, however, is that in their TV ads the campaign used\npoliticians such as David Cameron’s and others’ own words against them and employed these\nwords in insulting them (insult politics). By doing so, the Vote Leave Campaign was likely\naiming at 1) establishing trust with the readers by showing themselves as caring for and on\nthe same side with the voters, thus providing reason why the voters should trust the campaign\nand that the UK should leave the EU; and 2) shaping the reader’s perception that the EU is a\nburden on the UK in the form of encouraging immigration, restricting the UK’s sovereignty,\ndraining its economy and diminishing its younger generations’ future opportunities; 3)\ndiscrediting politicians that support the Remain Campaign, and therefore, charge people\nagainst them and ‘vote leave’.\nType of advertisement\nExcept for two advertisements, all ads in this group were negative (attack) ads on the\nEU and the politicians that supported the Remain Campaign. One other ad was a contrast ad\ncomparing the NHS in the case the UK was a member of the EU vs. outside of the EU.\nThe ads in this group were weaponized not only to launch general attacks on the EU,\nbut also were used to discredit and even ridicule politicians that supported the Remain\nCampaign. This difference was attributed to what TV ads provides in terms of containing\nmore information and features than the dark ads. Moreover, the ads were remarkably to\ncontain first-order principles and had no sign of what their plan after would be leaving the\nEU.\nThe sample suggests that these negative (attack) ads were aiming at raising readers’\ndoubts in the, back then, current political establishment in the UK represented by these\npoliticians supporting Remain, urging those readers to Vote Leave. By doing so, the\ncampaign was likely aiming at mobilizing the readers against the remain politicians, and\n68
therefore, make readers lose faith in the EU that they signify. This was mainly done by\nemotionalizing the reader’s experience and by setting their agenda around the aforementioned\ntopics (issues agenda).\nIn the attempt of emotionalizing the readers’ experiences, the campaign was likely\ndoing so by employing advertising techniques that would raise the reader’s fear and anxiety\ntowards politicians such as David Cameron. In ad 3.2 “[narrator:] David Cameron cannot be\ntrusted on Turkey, [David Cameron:] If your vote in this referendum is being influenced by\nconsiderations about Turkish membership of the EU, don’t think about it. It’s not remotely on\nthe cards, it’s not an issue in this referendum and it shouldn’t be.” The next scene in the ad\ndisplays members of the Turkish Parliament engaged in a physical fight to shape the reader’s\nperceptions about Turkish politicians, that are supposedly elites that care more than normal\npeople about their public image, thus, implying that normal Turkish people may be worse to\nlive with. “[Narrator:] David Cameron now claims Turkey won’t join the EU but that’s not\nwhat he said before. [David Cameron]: This is something I feel vary strongly about, very\npassionately about. Together, I want us to pave the road from Ankara to Brussels.” Finally,\nthe narrator reads the content of the dark ad 1.8 that claims that the UK is paying £2 billion\nfor “Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and Turkey to join the EU” and concludes that\n“you can’t trust David Cameron on Turkey. If you want to save the NHS, Vote Leave”.\nRhetorical appeals\nThe most used rhetorical appeal in group-three was the appeal strong emotions\n(pathos) that often appeared as an appeal to reasoning (logos) at first sight. For example, in\nad 3.1 that was a review of what politicians said about the EU and at the same time\ndisplaying outside proof of the opposite such as in ad 1 “[there is no question for any erosion\nof essential national sovereignty. Edward Heath, Prime Minister 1970- 1974. [narrator] for\nover 40 years we’ve been told lots of things about the EU, but were they true? [...]”. The\nagent was appealing to reason with the interpreter to convince them that what they were\nbeing told about the relationship between the UK and the EU is not true. Thus, providing\nreasons to assess this relationship differently (logos). However, the construction of the ad was\ndone in a way that charges the readers negatively from the politicians that support the UK\nmembership in the EU, especially with strong emotions such as anger. Also, in ad 3.4 titled\n“Our money. Our priorities.” This ad was also attacking the EU through the yet-to-become\nmember states countries “[narrator] every week we send £ 350 million to Brussels. Money\nthat’s wasted. That’s enough to build a new hospital every week. It will get worse. Imagine\nwhat will happen to public services when Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and\n69
Turkey join the EU”. In this ad, the agent is giving hypothetical situations where the UK’s\nmoney is spent on people from other countries and charging the readers with anger against\nthe EU that is driven from the act of wasting the UK’s financial resources.\nFinally, the appeal to credibility (ethos). This appeal was also highly interwoven with\nthe other appeals, however, due to the repetition of the same information that projected\nknowledge authority in the form of exhibiting financial losses to the UK, this appeal was the\nleast effective in terms of use.\n5.4
Group-four\nThis group was formed from the TV ads that were used by Donald Trump in his
campaign (2016) to answer the sub-question: what were the persuasive techniques of the\nTrump campaign national TV commercials during the US presidential elections 2016?\nRhetorical techniques\nRhetorical functions\nThe rhetorical functions used in the ads in this group suggested the campaign’s focus\non an issues-agenda similar to the Facebook ads in group-one. Agenda-setting and voterlearning were highly interwoven due to the extensive use of attacks that were launched on\nClinton during the campaign. By focusing on those rhetorical techniques, the campaign was\nlikely aiming at 1) portraying Clinton as a failed, corrupt and risky politician, thus, a\ndangerous choice to vote for, and simultaneously, 2) portray Trump as the leader that will\n“flip Washington up-side-down” to “Make America Great Again”.\nThe advertisements also focused on feeding the reader’s negativity bias and appealed\nto certain strong emotions. The feeding of the reader’s negativity bias was done in a similar\nway as in the Facebook ads, however, was in sophistication. For example, more topics were\nadded to the TV ads such as those that are related to the economy. In ad 4.5, that was an\nadvocacy ad titled “what does electing Donald Trump mean for you?”, the agent focused on\ntopics that appeal to the working class, the middle class in particular, and provided more\ninformation about actual money figures that helped structure the reader’s expectations about\nthe benefits that would follow the election of Trump. In this ad answering the question\nmentioned in the title, “Families making $60,000 a year, you get a 20% tax reduction.\nWorking moms, you get paid maternity leave and up to $5,000 childcare tax reduction.\nBusiness owners, your taxes get cut from 35 to 15% so you can expand and create more\njobs.”
70
The feeding of the negativity bias was linked to the immense use of first-order\nprinciples in the advertisements and during the absence of reliable information about secondorder principles.\nTrump used the ad nauseam and lying and the main rhetorical strategies. The ad\nnauseam strategy was repeatedly used across the ads. Statements such as “It’s more of the\nsame but worse” , “she failed us as Secretary of State, don’t let her fail us again” and “Hillary\nfailed” to refer to Clinton, and “change that will make America great again” to refer to Trump\nwere unified and in many times repeated not only in several ads, but repeated several times\nwithin the same ad.\nTypes of ads\nMost of the ads found in this group were contrast and negative (attack) ads. Only two\nads were advocacy ads. The analysis revealed a single form that all contrast ads followed in\ntheir construction. The contrast ads contained of two main parts. The first part was used to\nlaunch personal attacks on Clinton and in one case on her family. This part was mainly ‘dark’\nand started with dark images, imagery, and narration. For example, ad 4.3 “In Hillary’s\nAmerica, the middle class gets crushed, spending goes up, taxes go up, hundreds of\nthousands of jobs disappear. It’s more of the same but worse.” In this ad, the agent stroke\nchords that concern the American economy and the life of the middle class. This example of\nsetting the reader’s agenda about the economy and their will being was visible across most of\nthe contrast and negative ads.\nThe attacks launched by the Trump 2016 campaign on Clinton in both the contrast\nand negative (attack) ads were on three levels. The first level was the attack on Clinton’s poor\nperformance in the Department of State. This was done through mentioning information\nabout topics such as the Iran nuclear program, the Russian reset that led to the seizing of the\nCrimean Peninsula in Ukraine, the formation of terrorist groups such as ISIS (ad 4.10). The\nsecond level was to show Clinton as physically unfit to take office and perform the\npresidential tasks. This was done through a series of images of Clinton coughing, passing out,\nand being held and put in her car by her security details that implied her lack of fitness (ad\n4.6) that mentions “[…] Hillary Clinton doesn’t have the fortitude not the stamina to lead the\nworld […]”. Although the images were not part of the analysis for group Three and Four,\nimportant highlights were mentioned when needed. Finally, the third level was to attack\nClinton’s financial integrity (ad 4.7) that described Clinton as “filthy rich”.\nThe sample suggests that the main aim form the negative (attack) and the parts used in\nthe contrast ads that attacked Hillary Clinton was that these ads were crafted for the purpose\n71
of raising fear, anger, and anxiety towards the situation where Clinton would be elected\npresident. The use of dark and grey imagery complimented with suspenseful music were a\ncommon strategy in these ads.\nThe advocacy and the contrast ads used to shed positive light on Trump provided\nmainly first-order principles. Remarkedly, the campaign used the advocacy ads to answer\nsome of the accusations that Trump was xenophobic, racist, and misogynistic. It was also\nused to shape the reader’s perceptions about the candidate. For example, Trump used footage\nof African-Americans to resemble the American family, or when he referred to the\n‘American dream’ such as in ads (4.2 and 4.3). The campaign showed promises of Trump’s\nsupport for women (usually appealed to Caucasian women with the absence of black or any\nother races), especially, the working women. In ad 4.5, the ad was narrated by Ivanka Trump,\nTrump’s daughter and an entrepreneur. In the ad “[…] Donald Trump understands the needs\nof a modern workforce. My father will change outdated labor-laws so that they support\nwomen, and American families […]” (own emphasis). The use of “my father” was seen as an\nattempt to appeal to women who see themselves like Ivanka Trump or have an admiration for\nher. Moreover, the use of a soft tone with uplifting music was to give the ad a positive vibe\nand gain the reader’s trust.\nRhetorical appeals\nThe main rhetorical appeal salient in this group was the appeal to emotions (pathos)\nsuch as fear, anger and anxiety. By focusing on these appeals, the campaign was likely\naiming at shaping, with strong emotions, the reader’s perceptions about Clinton and their\nissues-agenda. The appeal to emotions, however, was highly intertwined with the appeals to\ncredibility (ethos), and reasoning (logos).\nFor the appeal to credibility (ethos), it usually complemented the appeal to emotions,\nespecially in the contrast ads. As mentioned earlier, the contrast ads started by focusing\nnegatively on Clinton, which the appeal to emotions (pathos) was the most salient. Next, in\nthe part that focuses positively on Trump, the appeals were mainly to build his credibility\n(ethos) as a trustworthy contender. By combining both credibility (ethos) and positive\nemotions (pathos), the ads, indirectly, appealed to reasoning (logos) because of how the\nreader, in case they accept the information of the ad would think of Trump as ‘the right\nchoice’.

Discussion\nThis research investigated the persuasion techniques that were present in
advertisements of the Vote Leave Campaign in the UK before the event of Brexit, and the\nadvertisements of the Trump 2016 campaign before the U.S. presidential elections that\ncontained disinformation, commonly known as ‘fake news’. The existing studies on\ndisinformation, especially in its persuasion techniques remains limited. This research relied\non existing literature and research on political communication, disinformation, and the\npopulist rhetorical techniques.
6.1
Main conclusions\nFor the advertisements in the two campaigns, the results suggest that both campaigns
adopted similar persuasion strategies. The only difference was in the implementation which\nwas attributed to the different logics that rule the two different events (referendum vs.\nelections), and to the political-cultural differences that shape the political sphere in both\ncountries. The two campaigns focused, proportionately, on the same issues-agenda immigration, economy and trade, sovereignty and international relations (Norris and\nInglehart, 2019). The only difference is that the Trump campaign also focused on more issues\nthat are related to the political-cultural conflict around the 2nd Amendment and the right to\nbear arms, which is not of importance in the British context (Norris and Inglehart, 2019).\nAlso, this focus varied in the display on the ads according to each campaign’s own\nobjectives. Thus, marking the importance of the different contexts in the two countries, and\nhow this affects the choice of the ad content.\nThe use of disinformation in both campaigns, if Alaphilippe et al. (2019) is true about\namplifying political messages, seemed to serve both campaigns in terms of not only\npersuasion, but also had other important functions. The rhetorical functions in both\ncampaigns included the main techniques used by populists in their political communication.\nVoter-leaning was used as a tool to shape readers’ perceptions about how corrupt the EU is.\nSimilarly, the Trump Campaign used the same tactic to persuade the U.S. readers that Hillary\nClinton is corrupt and unfit for presidential tasks. Agenda-setting was also a common\ntechnique in the ads in both campaigns. This technique, in both campaigns was mostly found\nin combination with voter-learning and/or strong emotions\nPropaganda techniques were also visible in the analyzed ads. Strong emotional\nappeals to emotions such as fear, anger and anxiety were used to persuade readers in both\n73
countries by both campaigns to build a base of supporters to from what was referred to earlier\nas tribes to reach political polarization that plays a role in not only building the social barriers\nbetween people, but also play a role in building loyalty . Also, strong emotional appeals\n(pathos) were employed to further scotomize those that lean more towards anti-European and\nanti-immigration sentiments in the UK, likewise, was used in the U.S. for the purpose of\nbuilding social barriers, by focusing on ideological and controversial issues to divide readers.\nThe negative (attack) ads were highly similar in both groups in the way they were\ncrafted, but also due to the differences in the two campaign types, the Trump attacks were\nmore insulting and personal than the ones used in the Vote Leave ads including the ads\ncrafted by the BeLeave campaign.\nBoth campaigns relied heavily on first-order principles (Norris and Inglehart, 2019)\nand did not provide any useful information to the reader about what could be done in order to\nfix these issues.\nThe thematic analysis revealed corresponding selective themes for Facebook\nads/posts. Each campaign had two selective themes, one shapes the opponent negatively, the\nother shapes the future without the opponent positively. Group-one ads suggest that the Vote\nLeave Campaign promoted to the reader that the EU possesses a national threat to the UK.\nSimilarly, the Trump Campaign ads suggested that the campaign promoted that it would be a\nrisk for America in the case where Clinton is elected president. Moreover, Vote Leave ads\nsuggested the selective theme UK’s future that includes both positive and negative scenarios\nabout the future of the UK, in or outside the EU. The Trump campaign ads suggested the\nselective theme save America where the agent was urging the readers to save their beloved\ncountry by extensively appealing to nationalism.\nTherefore, both campaigns were using the highly similar persuasion techniques,\nhowever, this similarity was also contextual.\n6.2
Socio-theoretical implications and study limitations\nIn general, the ads of both campaigns were of high sophistication due to several
factors. First, a number of ads (dark ads) were designed by psychologists to appeal to specific\nreaders’ segments more than others which was something new at the time. Second, due to the\ncultural conflicts in the two countries where the two campaigns existed, the ads creation\ncontained references to ideological issues that require the awareness of these conflicts and the\ndifferent stance-points that exist on the issues. Finally, the ads containing disinformation,
74
adds a layer of sophistication in terms of distracting the reader’s ideas about the content of\nthe ad.\nWhile this study was an exploratory attempt to clarify persuasion techniques in ads\nthat contained disinformation, this study had its limitations. Due to that studying persuasion\ntechniques in disinformation ads/campaigns is relatively a new discipline, the absence of\nresearch on this topic may have had, an unnoticeable, negative effect on this study.\nMoreover, the absence of studies on the effectiveness of specific rhetorical strategies have\nrestricted my understanding of their intentions as strategies, and therefore, may have played a\nrole in wrongly concluding the aims of the ads in terms of persuasion purposes. Also, the\nshort texts on the Facebook ads has played a role in shortening the thematic analysis of these\nads. It would have been more beneficial to analyze the TV advertisements for that purpose,\nbut as aforementioned, this was not possible due to the size of this study.\nAs for future research on the topic, the combination of deception and ad nauseam as\nmain rhetorical strategies added to the complexity and, perhaps, the effectiveness of these ads\nin the persuasion process. Due to the nature of this study, it was not possible to measure its\neffects in terms on persuading readers. Therefore, further studies on these two rhetorical\nstrategies may indeed enrich scholarly understanding of the effective persuasion strategies.\nAlso, further research on the persuasion techniques in disinformation ads/campaigns, in\nseveral contexts, is useful to understand its strengths and weaknesses.\nOne of the main results in this study is that it confirmed the intensive use of firstorder principles in the ads to address readers. While it should be self-evident to the reader\nthat the agent in the ad is just criticizing their opponent and not providing any solutions, it\nwould be beneficial to further investigate if adding a layer of deception through\ndisinformation would play a role in persuading the reader more easily than if ads did not\ncontain any false news/information. Finally, while there are studies that researched insult\npolitics, the role these insults play in persuading readers remains under studied and would be\nbeneficial to be added to the scholarly work.\nFor the societal implications of the study, this study possesses historical and societal\nvalue to those concerned with democracy transformations in Western societies, and the role\nmedia may play in that transformation. The reader’s ability to spot the appeals and techniques\nthat orators or agents employ in their political communication, may indeed help the reader\nbetter decide their aims. Additionally, by realizing the intentions behind these types of ads,\nthe reader will be more critical about the news/ information they receive form these types of\nads or campaigns, making them better able to spot disinformation.\n75
